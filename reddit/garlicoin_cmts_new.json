To properly overclock a card for mining you need to increase its memory, decrease its core and finally undervolt it.

Currently you can only mine on the testnet so anything mined will be wiped when the real garlicoin is released on the 21st.\n\nAlternatively, if you're super lazy like me here are the links to set up the miners: [CPU Mining](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZAkwES-kyoMwKkLT48IPz96H-vxZzd2W0Fn4HPomFu8/edit#) &amp; [GPU mining](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17s6l2B3wX_LMs8Gwp2UiP-L6FL2kMgSM_etcOo33gxQ/edit#).

It's fairly straightforward once you understand the 'Proof of Work' (PoW) concept that secures the network and verifies transactions. Since Garlicoin is a fork of Litecoin, I assume it will use the cryptographic hashing algorithm 'Scrypt' that is used as the PoW for Litecoin. To mine Garlicoin, you will need to first determine if your computer's GPU and/or CPU are up to the task (speed, cooling, overclock settings, etc.), then find a mining program (miner) that supports Scrypt and your hardware. Then you need to find a Garlicoin mining pool to connect your miner to. Each pool will have unique instructions on how to set up your mining program. When set up correctly, often by inputting specific commands saved in a config file, the miner will use your GPU/CPU to create Scrypt hashes as fast as your hardware can. When your miner is connected to a pool, it is working alongside other miners to find an acceptable hash for the group of transactions waiting to be confirmed. By participating in this group effort to find the right answer to a complex math problem as fast as possible, you are working towards proving that group of transactions are valid. To reward you for your mining work, you are awarded Garlicoin proportionate to the amount of hashes contributed. Mining costs money (electric bills) but also secures the network and rewards you with the currency you are helping to transact.\n\nEach cryptocurrency is unique, and there are thousands and thousands of cryptos out there. Since Garlicoin isn't released yet, I'd suggest trying out [Nicehash](nicehash.com) to get a sense of the mining process.

They are insured, quick, and simple to use. The absolute only reason he said 'BitPanda' (which I've never even heard of, and I've been in crypto for a while now) was so that he could tell you to use his referral link which would give him money.\n\nHere is my Kucoin referral if you really must use one: 1ubxH\nHere is my Binance referral: 13151576\n\nAlso, I didn't say anything bad about KuCoin or Binance because there isn't anything wrong with them. I just called you out on the fact that your post was made 100% because of your referral links, and the main proof was that you recommended some random exchange with a referral link instead of the most trusted websites in the entire crypto world- Coinbase and GDAX.", "score": 2}, {"body": "Meme coins are fun and all. But if you are actually interested in getting into crypto, it's not that hard. There is one barrier that's a little annoying, and that is that most exchanges do not accept 'real' money. That is, you have to have some crypto already, and send that to the main exchanges. There are some exchanges that do accept real money, but they tend to have very few crypto currencies you can trade.  I used [Bitpanda](https://www.bitpanda.com/?ref=4329769046612101412) to buy my first crypto. There are others, but that's the one I went with a few months ago. Regardless of which one you use, you'll have to get verified, because governments want to be able to check who is hiding their wealth in crypto. Then you buy one of the cryptos they have, preferably Litecoin or Ethereum, which have fast transactions. Bitcoin is more congested, and therefore slow right now.\n\nThen you get an account on [Binance](https://www.binance.com/?ref=11598073) or [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=1wHub). Preferably both, since they don't always get new coins at the same time. Look up your deposit address on those and send your coin there from your first exchange. Make sure it's the right address you copied, because if for example you send Bitcoin (BTC) to an Ether (ETH) address, you lose that money forever, and no one can help you get it back. When it arrives, sell your coin for BTC (Bitcoin), and then buy whatever coin you are interested in. You have to do at least a little research to decide which coins you like, because some of them will go down in value if it looks like they have no use case being developed.\n\nThe links I included are my referral links, and I would be happy if you used those. There is no downside for you, but the exchanges give a small referral bonus if people sign up with your link, so I try to include them just in case. You can find the sites easily google if you prefer, but I would appreciate if you used my referral codes if you found this helpful.

I mean think about the amount of work needed to manage this page, deal with development issues for miners and users, talking to other exchanges, plus work their 40 hour job. This isn't a bambozzle, [if they tried, they would end up in jail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2-1wcJYrWA).

I had to exchange GRLC into BTC which I converted to USD to pay my bill. To my surprise I made a profit. This made me think. I can make my life more affordable through GRLC by letting my miners work for me. Then I realized the more efficient way would be to make my electricity cheaper so I can mine more efficiently. So, I'm saving up to invest in a better GPU to mine with and designing a personal sustainable energy system to maximize my profits in the future. I began researching how to be more efficient, I learned the basics of particle physics and energy conversion. Everything is energy around us, we just need to convert it to something we can use and store efficiently.

There are other things you can play with in there, but wouldn't recommend until you get the basics down and research more. It's not extremely efficient on a cpu but if you're doing it for fun it doesn't matter too much. That's the basics so you can tell if it's something you want to do.

Still an MD to bug if you ever get stuck which is nice to have that security if you wanted it.    \n- A nurse (RN) has say 4-5 patients and gets to spend time with them all day - they usually do like 14 shifts a month for 12hrs each so 3-4 per week. I think PA similar.    \n- Both of those above, you get paid by the hour and any desires to make more money can easily be filled with overtime shifts. Tired? Work your 3-4 shifts. Need money? Work 5-6 etc. Pick up overnights (which tend to be quieter etc).     \n- Doctor needs to specialize: you do 4 years of med school and then get stuck with a 3-5 year residency to solidify your specialty.\n- PA can switch specialities (please fact check me on this one though): you do college and then I think 2-3 years of PA school and you can apply to work for any specialty, again fact check me but I believe they are then able to move around between specialties if they want and be a PA for orthopedics, surgery, medicine, cardiology, etc.     \n- Like critical care? You can be a telemetry (cardio floor) or critical care nurse and it pays more and you have less patients - that is something I'd consider.     \n- Average starting salaries (from my knowledge, please comment if anyone knows better) in Northeast USA are MD (150-250), PA (100-150), RN (80-125) - factor in years spent and school loans and your eyes will open. \n- Exams for MD - think your MCAT is bad, MDs have 4x 9hr board exams and 1 of them is 2 days of that. Exams for PA and RN I don't have any accurate knowledge of.\n\nGood luck! Feel free to share the knowledge with anyone in your situation.

On 12/30/17 I gave up my career in medicine as a doctor in NYC to go into cryptocurrency full-time. I had finished 4 years of college, 4 years of medical school, had a fun year in the Bahamas teaching sailing while applying for residency, and then most recently finished 3 long years in an internal medicine residency program  at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn. I had reached the light at the end of the tunnel. Shortly after I started working full-time as an attending with my full salary and all the bells &amp; whistles of being a senior doctor.   \n\nNow, why I changed careers:  \nI was always very passionate about science and the knowledge of medicine. Very very very curious person. I won't lie to you and tell you I had this burning desire to cure the world everyone &amp; everything, but I was passionate about the practice and knowledge contained within - if as a bonus I help others I could not be more happy. You need to love what you do. For me that was this. In fact in wouldn't change a thing about my educational past and I would have done it all again just for the knowledge gained.   \n\nAs I went through the years in the field, rising through the ranks, I started to dislike what I was seeing. The medical field today I realized.....it wasn't about the medicine, it wasn't about the people, and it wasn't about the excitement for the unique ailments we saw/treated.  (And trust me in NYC/Brooklyn you see some things, you are just as likely to see a patient with Rolex as you are one with diseases you thought were only in 3rd world countries).   \n\nI saw what was happening to medicine: political pressure, financial pressures, insurance companies, billing rules, big pharma - it was turning medicine into a big giant business where profits and length of stay ( = time a patient was allowed in the hospital before we tried to kick them out) were the primary focus. Medicine now spends more time figuring out how to kick a patient out faster than spending time with them. You want to talk to the patient? Be a nurse. Seriously. As a physician if I spent more then 5-10 minutes in a room I'd get laughed for being slow. My number one comment from patients when I asked if they had any questions? \"Wow, you are one of the few that asks if I understand, and no thank you so much for explain I don't have any questions!\" But don't blame the doctors, all our training is spent making sure we do that, then we show up to a system that doesn't allow for it. They want you to say hi, treat, document 10 pages per patient, bill, and kick them out fast. You can't spend time in the room if you have 25 patients - it's not possible. The system is flawed. I refused to treat my patients as $$$ and not people. I said fuck it.  \n\nSo my thoughts on being a doctor?  \nMy passion: gone.  \nMy desire to be part of this system: gone.  \nThe salary: meaningless.  \n\nIf you don't love what you do, if you aren't passionate about it, nothing else around you will flow. You WANT to wake up every morning, not dread it. The joy you get from there will spread to the rest of the things in your life. If you are going to blow a ton of money on a good mattress because hey you spend a lot of your life sleeping, then why not do that with a job you're going to spend the rest of your life doing?    \n    \n\n#**Remember this if anything from me: We are not the generations of old, just because you have spent 20 years doing one career does not mean you need to spend the next 30, 40, or 50 years miserable by continuing it! Be happy, find a passion, find something that calls out to you!**          \n\n#Cryptocurrency found me.     \n         \nIt was exciting, fast-paced and I found myself to be very good at it. I enjoyed it, I enjoyed teaching other excited individuals, loved to spread the knowledge I had gained, and I found I was able to support myself with it. Plus it never asked me to put on my pants in the morning. A new passion was born!   \n\nI hope that answers your question, I would be more than happy to answer more. I know many of you here are medical students and residents as well, I've taken quite a few of you on board and teaching what I can! Help someone buy a bit of crypto today, share the possibility that is here!

Thats only 500 dollars, but you got 10000x times the amount you spent initially. By having coin that even ultra poor people can buy, you allow them to have the chance to use the coin and cash out too. Also, people usually say \"cryptocoins are getting so overvalued, you wont be able to sell it, when its the day you want to do that\", with more coins, you can have many poorer users buying your coins, you wont have to rely at few rich guys doing it.\n\nThe population density is a related but different thing. Money is a way to represent wealth, if you have two guys (A and B) and A is 99x times richer than then B, you will need at least 100 coins to represent that. If a third guy ( C ) is born and his wealth is the same of the poor guy ( A ) , 100 coins will not be enought, and you will need to create more coins to represent that. The problem is that this create inflation. So I created a extreme hypothetical situation (but based at real world events/data) with an earth that has extreme populational density and with one single guy that super ultra mega poor.\n\nAll this populational density stuff, was to give him some idea of max coin amount that would not need to increased further, NO MATTER WHAT.

When the card exploded it cracked the glass window in the side of my case instantly blinding my right eye and causing deep lacerations down my right arm and leg.  The explosion also cut out my fuse box and instantly sent the house into blackness.  Bleeding, half blind and in the dark I had to drag myself upstairs, down a hall-wall and up our rough gravel driveway to the road where I hoped to find help.  But we live rural and for 2 hours no-one drove by.  I was still bleeding and didn't think I had much time left when finally I saw two headlight beams in the distance.  When the car pulled up I instantly knew I was even more screwed.  Five guys in black balclavas and holding a mixture of firearms (Kalashnikovs and a variety of smaller Soviet era handguns) jumped out and looked down at me.  I don't know where they were going, or what they had intended to do, but seeing me obviously changed their minds and they threw me in the back of the rusty matt black van.  Sometime later I must have passed out from the bleeding.  Things weren't any better when I woke up.  I was lying in what I eventually worked out was a small room with absolutely no light.  Someone had tied a rag (it felt like an old t-shirt) around the wound on my eye and some smaller cloth around my arm.  I was still so weak I could hardly sit up.  Frozen in fear I lay in the dark for hours.  \n\nI eventually found that they'd left me a bucket of water and a box of stale crackers in the corner of the small cell.  I accidentally knocked half the bucket of water over when I first found it and so much of that precious liquid disolved into the concrete floor.\n\nHours/Days went by.\n\nI ended up shitting and pissing in the corner away from the pile of mouldy smelling blankets they'd left me as bed but the piss always streamed it's way back over.\n\nI don't know how long I was in there.  I never heard a sound outside the door, not a voice, or a rumble of a vehicle, no dogs barking.  I screamed until my throat felt like it was bleeding, banged on the concrete walls and iron door until my fist was fractured but nothing.  No reason, no sound, no light, no people.  Just a bucket of water.  I eventually ate the cardboard box that the crackers had been in, just to have something in my stomach.\n\nFinally at some point, so weak that I couldn't even move, with my water gone lying in a pool of my own piss I gave up.  No-one was coming for me.  \n\nAnd then I woke up in hospital. My wife next to me. I'd been in a coma for 4 days. A homeless guy had found me dumped in the bushes by the hospital.  \n\nNo-one knows who took me or why.  The armed men never performed any crime that anyone knows about.\n\nMy wife eventually left me.  I think it was my disfigurement that pushed her away, although she told me I was obsessed with garlicoin and had warned me earlier that it would ruin our lives.  I guess she was right in a funny kind of way.\n\nI don't leave the house anymore.  I'm too scared to fire up my miner.  But I can't stop thinking about it.  I need more Garlicoin.  Garlicoin owes me.  It took my wife, my GPU, my sight and my sanity. \n\nThis Garlicoin is my only hope.\n\nGWYPZ5szZFWhaLxKtyAZXokbJ2sDnWzuDZ", "score": 88}, {"body": "I know I won't be at the top so feel free to have an upvote from me!\n\nIn case I get one of the random selections though: Gfx4SJiv9JkUffmzK3X1A16JzM4kJyBd3x", "score": 2}, {"body": "I feel like no one is going to upvote other\u2019s comments in an effort to make their higher.

Garlic has gifted us humans countless uses of itself between its conquering and heady potency, its medicinal values, and its meme-ability. Oh, and who could forget about the sole thing which brought Garlicoin into existence, Garlic Bread of course. Specifically, a love and appreciation for Garlic Bread has stitched this community together, which has pushed this crypto from just another shitcoin, damned to sulk through the tall shadows of the crypto giants, into the greatest memecoin to ever grace the earth. \n\nIf you don't mind, I'd like to quote some passages from the Cryptominer's Guide to the Internet:\n\n\"I described myself as the second greatest,\" intoned Dogecoin, \"and such I am.\"\n\nAnother worried look passed between the two miners. Blockchang cleared his throat.\n\n\"There must be some mistake,\" he said, \"are you not a greater crypto than NyanCoin, which revitalizes one of the most random and spontaneously popular memes of the early 2010s\"\n\n\"NyanCoin?\" said Deep Thought with unconcealed contempt. \"A mere shitcoin--mention it not.\"\n\n\"And are you not,\" said Hashrati leaning anxiously forward, \"a greater coin than Pepecoin, which combines the internet's infatuation with Pepe the Frog with the internet's fervent obsession of cryptocurrencies as well as memes?\"\n\n\"Pepe the Frog?\" said Dogecoin haughtily. \"You ask this of me who have managed to create the largest memecoin, a memecoin out of one of the most obnoxious memes ever? Molest me not with this kilohash stuff\"\n\nThe two miners sat in uncomfortable silence for a moment. Then Blockchang leaned forward again.\n\n\"But are you not,\" he said \"a more fiendish coin than CoinyeWest?\"\n\n\"CoinyeWest,\" said Dogecoin, accentuating the c in the name \"could let ASIC miners suck up all of the blockchain rewards--but only I could convince the GPU-plebs to hodl.\"\n\n\"Then what,\"asked Fook, \"is the problem?\"\n\n\"There is no problem,\" said Dogecoin with magnificent ringing tones. \"I am simply the second greatest computer in the Universe of Space and Time.\"\n\n...\n\n\"You know nothing of future time,\" pronounced Dogecoin, \"and yet in my teeming circuitry I can navigate the infinite delta streams of future probability and see that there must one day come memecoin whose merest operational parameters I am not worthy to calculate, but which it will be my fate to eventually design.\"\n\nAmen.\n\nIf Garlicoin is nothing more than a bunch of messy code, forked from a better coin, then my life's (2 weeks) work is pointless. I have faith in the Garlic, and faith in the Garlicoin. No matter what may become of our beloved, in terms of market cap, price, or whatever may arise, I will always cherish the time I have spent mining, and the time I have spent fawning over my own Garlicoins.

Memes used to be simple. Relatable. Worth a chuckle. Then they evolved. New formats, new tag lines, new content that was then turned into a new meme. Then memes became increasingly meta and self reflective. They parodied themselves and the users who both made them and consumed them. They built off of one another. They grew. They morphed into something entirely novel. This progressed to the point where even that wasn't enough. They had to become something more than themselves. They became surreal. They became deep fried and nuked. Each flavor building off of the last and transforming into a nearly intangible, unknown entity.\nArt progressed in a similar fashion. Started off simple, I'm talking cave drawing simple. Then some pottery and some small abstract sculptures. Subjects everyone could relate to and understand. Then, as technology allowed for the creation of cultures and societies, art began to reflect that change and it evolved along with it. By the Ancient Greeks and Romans, art had become a more advanced version of the Stone and Bronze Age arts. Better drawings, paintings, and the addition of mosaics. Sculptures eventually shifted from stylistic expression to naturalistic representation. Still accessible to everyone, yet more nuanced and complex.\nAfter the fall of Rome art stagnated and didn't change very much for nearly a millennium. Early Christian art dominated for the most part, consisting of murals and frescos and simple statues. All of which were based on the Ancient styles. Romanesque and Gothic art also built upon these precedents. This all changed when the Renaissance attacked.\nA cultural explosion changed the art world forever; arguably starting with the Italian artist, Giotto. He began using techniques like foreshortening and linear perspective so that the material world could be represented as it appeared to us. A callback to the naturalistic stylings of the Greeks. Almost like a reference to the days of yore. A celebration of how art used to be, but with the explosion of new techniques and technologies, the art grew increasingly diverse. New and improved frescoes, meticulously crafted sculptures, architectural marvels and the inclusion of new materials in these works. Instead of tempera, oil was introduced along with new styles of depicting light and shadow through sfumato and chiaroscuro. These techniques and stylistic changes, while impressive, were simply an advancement of pre established art. The Renaissance paved the way for the explosion and diversification of dozens of art movements that followed.\nFrom prehistoric art to the end of the Renaissance, art was mostly about the same subjects and used similar techniques to accomplish the goal of producing a work of art. Yes, the technical proficiency exponentially improved but considering the centuries in between, few true advancements were made. Compare this to memes. They were so simple at first and really were nothing more. Then they got better. More technical. More circumstantial. More media to create them with. But memes could last years or many months before dying off. As time went on, the longevity of a meme shortened. This is paralleled in the art world. After the Renaissance the Baroque period started. Then the Neo-Classicism, Romantic, Realism, and Impressionism movements not long after. Still utilizing the same technical process but the reasoning behind the movements changed. No longer was it about simply depicting the world around us, it was about prompting the viewer to consider new thoughts and ideas. Urging them to look past the image and think deeper about meaning and context. Pushing the boundaries of what art could be. The Baroque to Impressionism era spanned roughly 300 years. Compare that to the thousands of years between archaic art and the Renaissance. It was a huge explosion of self expression. Finally, in the mid to late 19th century starting with Post-Impressionism, Modern art emerged. This movement focused on self-consciousness, self-reference, introspection, existentialism, and even nihilism. I'm talking Fauvism, Cubism, Futurism, Dada, Abstract Expressionism, and Surrealism to name the most well known.\nThese styles changed what art could be. They were no longer about depicting life as is, or layering a painting with hidden motifs for only the privileged to understand, they were in and of themselves absurd. Abstract shapes, aggressive lines and colors, nonsensical dreamscapes. But it didn't stop there.\nPost-modernism. Pushing art to the limit of its potential. Pop art, Conceptual art, Minimalism, Fluxus, Installation art, Lowbrow art, Performance art, Digital art, Earth art. These movements are about skepticism, irony, rejecting grand narratives and reason and instead embracing the idea that knowledge and truth are the result of social, historical, and political discourse and subsequently are a subjective, social construct. It's irreverent and self-referential. It's avant-garde pushed to 11. But what's next? Post-postmodernism? Metamodernism? Hypermodernity? Who knows? Only time will tell.\nThis is where memes are headed. They started off slow but have picked up so much momentum they're evolving at an exponential pace. They used to hang around for a couple years at most. Then it turned to months. Then maybe only one month. Suddenly it was a week tops. While some particularly great memes do still stick around much like the masterpieces of art in the past, new memes are created every day, every few hours. New movements of memes are being created all the time. Anti-memes. Dank memes. Abstract memes. Wholesome memes. Surreal memes. Deep fried memes. Nuked memes. Even black hole memes, time travel, and dimensional memes are now a reality. What's going to happen next? A return to the classics? A new format so brilliant it steals all our hearts and then starts a whole new movement? I'm excited for the future of memes.\nTL; DR: Memes imitate art, art imitates life.

It's slightly ghetto, but it's simple and costs about $30 in parts, plus a $20 PVC pipe cutting tool, and can be assembled in an hour or two. This was the first time I've built anything out of PVC, and it went pretty smoothly. It's about 24\" x 18\" x 20\", to match the piece of plexiglass I had, but I just cut pipes to fit what I needed as I went. I cut about 1\" out of each corner of the plexiglass to make it sit just right on all 4 sides of the enclosure. Next time I do it I would add a crossbar on the bottom for support. You need 8 3-way angle connectors, and 4 T connectors. Make sure none of these connectors are threaded or the PVC won't fit (I accidentally bought 6 good ones and 2 that were threaded in one of the 3 holes, and had to go back to the store). I think you can order these on Amazon too but I just went to Lowe's. I used 1/2\" PVC all around. \n\nThen I just put the motherboard in the plexiglass, mark the mounting holes carefully, remove the motherboard, drill holes into the plexiglass (carefully, it likes to crack), use motherboard mounting screws (the same ones you would use to mount it to an ATX case, the little riser things with a male in the bottom and female in the top). I don't remember the drill bit.. start small though and drill bigger holes slowly until the thing fits. This is the most annoying part. \n\nThe motherboard is the Prime Z270A, with 7 PCIe slots, and 2 other ports that can be converted to PCIe. Video cards are 1060s. PSU is a Seasonic 1200W platinum.

Setting that up, and overclocking it, is a whole other nightmare though, and most people would probably just want to use Windows with MSI Afterburner. \n\nSadly though, there are currently no video cards to buy at anywhere near a reasonable price, so I don't recommend building one of these immediately. \n\nedit: and for completeness, you also need: PCIe risers (good ones that take 6 pin PCIe or molex), Processor (Celeron), Memory (8 Gb DDR4), a 60Gb SSD (cheap), and at least 3 PCIe power splitters - 6/8 pin to 2x 8 pin. You also need to know how to wire it up without overloading any circuit. If you actually build it, research this part yourself, but the short version is use PCIe to power everything you can, including risers, molex as a secondary, and avoid SATA for power to risers (although I do use 2 SATA power adapters in this set up, my cards run cool, and I'm not overloading the circuits. If you're running a bunch of high powered AMD cards off SATA, it's bad news.

All pool owners decided (or at least those potentially in favor of a hard fork) that if we had a hard fork, it would require proper planning. This to prevent chain-splits and users (including potential exchanges) getting confused because they might be on the wrong chain, since this might (would) ultimately result in further price reduction and people leaving the scene because of distrust in the ecosystem.\n\nSo, once you are talking about a prepared, well-organized hard fork, the idea if simply locking a bunch of coins in place becomes a lot harder.\n\nWhat if part of these coins are sent to a different wallet before the fork activates? Ok, you can follow the coins and lock them into the other wallet. \n\nWhat if the 40k guy sends a small portion of the coins to other peoples wallets? Ok, you need to _only_ lock the coins of that single transaction for that specific wallet (hey, now a random user as a wallet balance of which they will not be able to spend part of it).\n\nWhat if the 40k guy sends a lot of small transactions to a lot of different random wallets (this has actually happened, or so I've been told, I did not check). What if some of the users accidentally perform valid transactions that include these coins (wallets typically auto-select inputs for new transactions) ? Either we somehow have to reverse blockchain history (very bad idea), or now we have valid transactions, but people not being able to actually use them (so now the \"locked balance\" issue is spreading).\n\nThen finally, what if a bunch of coins are sold before the hard fork activates, now users (or exchanges) might have unspendable coins without knowing until the fork happens.\n\nAs you can see, such a hard fork is not exactly easy to pull off, and with all the above complexity, a bunch of pool owners (myself included), wanted to have a clear idea what was going to happen and how all these issues where going to be solved before supporting any fork. We did not get the information and guarantees we were looking for, hence we did not support it.\n\nApart from all this, there were some pool owners that just plainly thought the hard fork was a bad idea anyhow, potentially causing more problems than it would solve regardless and that development time could be better used by improving the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nI hope this gives a bit of background and reasoning behind the majority decision to not support a fork. That said, not everyone was against it, and if you rather mine at a pool that did/does support a fork, I am sure that some pools will let you know their own standpoint. :-)\n\nEDIT: few words.", "score": 27}, {"body": "Here's an in-thread response from the freshgarlicblocks operator.

Firstly you need to decide whether to use a mining pool or mine on your own. If you mine on your own it takes much longer and there is a lower chance you'll actually get anything, but the payoff is higher. If you join a pool then you get less but you will receive payments more often. I'm a part of butter pool and it's working pretty well for me.\n\nSo onto how to mine. Firstly you need to find out what GPU you have and whether it's AMD or Nvidia. Then go to the butter pool website (butterpool.com) and download the relevent miner for your GPU manufacturer. While that's downloading go to the Garlicoin website and set up your wallet. The links are easy to follow so just download the client and set up your details. Open notepad and copy and paste the code below the download link for the miner, entering your wallet code. This can be found by clicking the receive tab and should be a strong of numbers and letters starting with a capital g. Extract the miner, which will have downloaded as a .zip, then save the notepad file as .bat in the new miner folder. Click on your new .bat file to run the miner and you should be up and running in a couple of minutes.

", "score": 10}, {"body": "**What is NiceHash?**\n\nNiceHash is a two sided marketplace:\n\n - a mining pool that pays in BTC\n - a place to buy computing power for mining\n\nSellers (owners of mining equipment) connect to NiceHash's pool, like they would any other pool (i.e., with stratum). Instead of choosing a coin, they choose an algorithm to mine (e.g., scrypt-n or lyra2rev2). Otherwise its standard mining.\n\nBuyers access the website, deposit BTC, specify how much they will pay for computing (in BTC per gigahash/s), and input the settings for the pool they want to mine on (e.g., grlc-bakery.fun). \n\nNiceHash then points their mining pool at the pool specified by buyer with the highest bid, and that buyer starts receiving payouts from the pool they specified just as if they themselves were running the miner. \n\n**What's the problem with mining Garlicoin via NiceHash?**\n\nThe issue is that NiceHash is a big marketplace, and so its easy for someone to buy a ton of hashing power, to the point that it drowns out smaller miners (meaning the difficulty of finding a block becomes too high for them to get a share). \n\nIn effect, the NiceHash buyer is acting just like someone with a huge rig (i.e., ASICs), which is against the design goals of Garlicoin (and some other coins, like Vertcoin). The developers want Garlicoin to stay mineable for people with GPUs, and so they are seeking to keep ASICs and other huge miners from being effective.\n\n**How does this relate to pump &amp; dump schemes?**\n\nIts relatively easy to mine a lot of garlicoin at the moment (due to the low difficulty of the blockchain), and it has a lot of attention and support. This allows a bad actor to 1) acquire a ton of garlicoin, 2) hype it up with bots (pump) and then 3) sell it all later (dump). \n\nThis can be done with any coin, but most other coins are either much higher difficulty or much lower value than Garlicion, so garlicoin becomes a pump &amp; dump target.\n\nBy changing the algorithm to one not supported by NiceHash, and not used by any other coin, the developers hope to keep people from being able to use NiceHash to mine garlicoin. NiceHash could add a pool for the new algorithm, but because no other coin uses it, that would be unlikely. The scrypt-n market (garlicoin's original algorithm) on NiceHash is already far smaller than any other algorithm.", "score": 3}, {"body": "I don't know why you were downvoted.

Furthermore, there's almost no counterparty risk since the money will just touch their exchanges will your transactions are being handled (a few minutes in the worst case).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Can the rates change during the transaction?**\n\nCryptocurrencies are highly volatile. The price can change considerably in a few minutes. In that case, the exchanged quantity which you receive may differ from what you saw during the comparison process.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**What are your fees?**\n\nSwitchain does not charge any extra fee. We receive a small commission(about 0.2%) from our partners with every trade.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Why can't I exchange pair XXX/YYY?**\n\nWe seek liquidity in other reputable exchanges. Sometimes specific trades will not be able to be filled, especially when dealing with assets with a smaller market cap.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**When should I receive my money?**\n\nSwitchain transactions take 15-30 minutes to be processed. If a trade is using BTC, it may take longer(up to 2h) due to network processing times.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Why is the deposit taking so long?**\n\nThe blockchain is a peer to peer network where transactions need to be confirmed by the system.

The comments in the Garlic Market's [\"Official Verification Thread\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/GarlicMarket/comments/7rxv0z/official_verification_thread_come_here_to_verify/). Here is where \"over the counter\" GRLC traders record their successful transactions to build up goodwill and trust with other traders. These comments have a strict format (though many users fail to adhere to it): all comments list an amount of GRLC, and some mention a dollar amount. These comments are interpreted as a record of executed sales, and the comment's creation timestamp is used to place the transaction chronologically.\n\nIn a liquid market such as a high-volume exchange, there will typically be an order book of high-priced asks and low-priced bids, with an unoccupied spread in between. Trades occur when these 2 overlap, and the overlap quickly disappears. The absence of a clear [bid-ask spread](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp) in the above plot is testament to the lack of liquidity of the Garlicoin market.\n\n**Discussion**\n\nThe price of Garlicoin steadily rose to a strong $2.50/coin within the first 3 days after launch, buoyed by the community's early enthusiasm and desire to add to the meagre pile of coins each had been able to mine on their home computers. After a few days, however, the few members who had access to powerful multi-GPU mining rigs had accrued hundreds (in some cases, thousands) of coins and began to flood the market with cheap, wholesale GRLC under $1.50. The [r/GarlicMarket](https://www.reddit.com/r/GarlicMarket) was underequipped to handle such volume and regular traders found themselves steadily lowering their asks in the pursuit of a sale, in vain.\n\nA psychological barrier at $1 may be responsible for slowing the decline, as traders refuse to part with their hard-mined Garlicoins for mere pennies. Now that the initial buzz of the launch has worn off (and with the impending 120,000-coin [airdrop](https://www.reddit.com/r/garlicoin/comments/7sikmp/garlicoin_airdrop_megathread/) threatening to dilute the supply further), it looks like it will be a while before GRLC climbs north of $2 again.\n\n**Comparison with Dogecoin**\n\nAt time of writing, [r/Garlicoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Garlicoin) has 137,791 subscribers, 28% more than [r/dogecoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/)'s 107,673. Given that both coins derive value primarily from the humour and dedication of their respective communities, it's not that far-fetched to imagine Garlicoin's market capitalisation rivalling Dogecoin's at some point in the future.\n\nDogecoin's circulating supply, at time of writing, is just under 113 billion coins, a factor of 1637 greater than the hard limit on Garlicoin's supply of 69 million coins. If GRLC were to match DOGE's market cap (currently $821 million), even with every single Garlicoin in circulation, we would see a per-coin valuation of $821 million / 69 million = $11.89. Whether Garlicoin can outlive the standard 15 minutes of fame afforded all memes remains to be seen - but if it can, it may yet provide 10X returns for early investors who stocked up on cheap wholesale coins in the $1 range.\n\n---\n\nGUT9ijJKzupn7FY88k8KB9vxxWwxw3kTRh", "score": 76}, {"body": "(\\^\u032e\\^)", "score": 3}, {"body": "Wow thats a pretty nice graph and job well done!", "score": 7}, {"body": "To aid mobile users, I'll link small subreddits not yet linked in the comments\n\n/r/GarlicMarket: Garlicoin Market!\n\nThis is a subreddit for Buying/Selling/Trading garlicoin\n\nRight now this subreddit is in a rough opening as the markets are opening soon.

Problem solved?  No, actually makes little difference of any kind.  If you are simply redenominating - it makes no difference.  If you are actually restricting the growth, it doesn't change the big picture, of static demand and increasing supply.  It simply changes the rate of the same problem.\n\nI'll explain, it doesn't matter that there are literally 100 times more pennies than dollars.  Denominating in pennies or dollars makes no difference in the dollar fiat market.\n\nHaving less garlic coin makes no difference whatsoever, if you are simply redenominating.  It makes a difference only in  marketing - if you did an air drops and gave someone a coin worth 1 cent, then thats going to result in no excitement whatsoever.  For psychological reasons, the GRLC marketing model doesn't work unless it stays above a buck.  So, redenominate, right.  But static interest, a mining model that produces more supply each day - combined with the risk of a new meme coin catching interest = no algo is fixing anything.\n\nThe garlic market is so full of disinformation.  \"New exchanges coming online\" - ok, great to report if you also admit that it has no impact on the market, due to the trivial size of these exchanges.  This news was reported as if it was going to have material impact on price, and so people rushed to buy in.  I was holding only enough GRLC to dump on the new exchange during the early hours when people were buying at the wrong price.  After that I got out completely - holding zero grlc, waiting for the next price drop.  And guess what else, I had zero compulsion to lie to people.  You can tell the truth, it doesn't change the big picture or the market - but it just might save the people close to you from making a mistake.\n\nIf a coin is going to be fun, people have to stop deceiving, because that just isn't fun.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with launching a new coin or having fun with it, or airdrops or dreams of lambos.\n\nBut misinformation crosses the line. \n\nWhen you cite 139K reddit readers, you should also mention a fair number of the readers don't purchase coin, or are like me - negative on it. If you don't, you are lying.\n\nWhen you talk about new exchanges coming online, mention when they don't have any direct btc to grlc pairings.  Because if GRLC redditors are being used to create float in the exchange currency - that's a detail to not leave out in the discussion.  It's no wonder that sales are extremely limited on some of these exchanges and price hasn't gone up - it's gone down.\n\nCollusion in the grlc market may seem like a last hope to bolster prices, but such partnerships fall apart.  The first to dump out is going   to get some value out of their coin, while those sticking to a hold agreement are going to be sitting on a pile of nothing.\n\ntldr; grlc is a worthy enterprise.

I'll give a quick overview.\n\nSupply and Demand is how price is determined in a capitalist system. If there is a lot of demand for a product, but low supply, the price goes up. This higher price makes it more lucrative for people to produce that product, increasing supply. The higher price also makes less people willing to purchase the product at that price, lowering demand. With higher supply and lower demand, the price drops. As the price goes down, more people are willing to purchase the product, so demand goes up. Eventually there is an equilibrium.\n\nSo let's apply it to Garlicoin. Right now, there is very small amount of coin in circulation. Most people that own it aren't selling. On the flip side, not very many people are trying to buy it either. That supply and demand equilibrium sets the price at ~$2.17 right now. People are willing to pay that price, and people are willing to sell at that price. If you dump a huge supply (like this pool) into the market, there aren't enough people out there willing to pay $2.17 for every coin they want to sell. So they would have to offer to sell for less in order to get people to want to buy. That would have an effect on everyone else trying to sell, since any buyers would be able to get a lower price from this pool. The price for the entire coin would drop as a result. \n\nIf the sales were done over longer periods, there would be enough time to find people willing to pay a higher price for the coin. It would absorb some of the impact of the increased supply. The price might go down a little bit, but not much.", "score": 2}, {"body": "Yes.

Caribbean island nations that depend on tourism dollars would see those disappear. Finally, the health of people around the world, not just in coral reef areas, would suffer, since coral is used in many medicines.\n\n&gt;...Many point out they can't predict everything that might happen if the coral reefs disappear.
