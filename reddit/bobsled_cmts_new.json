It is the very nature of something not heavily adopted yet that it will fluctuate.  Volatility is a necessary property of something that has the potential to go to the moon.  If there is no risk, there is little room for substantial profit.  We aren't supposed to be *truly* caring about the value anyway.  In order to make it big, you have to be willing to subject yourself to great risk.  It's just the way it is.\n\nDogecoin's long term viability is dependent on a few major factors: continued development, people convincing others to use it, and people beginning to accept it.  A currency is supposed to be a medium of exchange.  The more you spread it around and people accept it, the less volatile it will be, and it *will* climb.  They did things right with this currency.  We aren't stuck dealing in 1/10,000th's of a coin.  We aren't dealing with a physical barrier of production, which is a *really bad idea* for something people can lose permanently.  It has a defined, slow, steady rate of volume increase.  This is what made *gold* so stable when society accepted it as the baseline currency. *Supply was limited by the speed of mining*.  Dogecoin is *limited by the speed of mining and block release* as well.  \n\nThen there's fiat.  The thing that makes it better than fiat currency is that we aren't stuck having the Federal Reserve dictate arbitrarily how much should be in supply, inflating and devaluing based on how it feels we should be spending.  It's better because I transfer from my wallet to a random man in India within seconds for an essentially free transfer cost.  I can now *scan a person's phone* with my phone, and send them perfectly secure money.  It's the future.  Crypto is here to stay.  It's just our job to make sure that people realize that ours has the best design, rate of production, size, speed, and development for ease of use for the average Joe.  The best part about a meme currency is that it spread like a virus because it makes people laugh, and that was one of the main problems of others; if nobody has it, nobody can use it.

A lot of readers will not understand it on a fundamental level. Name the benefits of Dogecoin, how it took Litecoins scrypt, how it has a set inflation with the goal of becoming more like a currency then a commodity etc. In this explain what is mining, how to mine and get all that jazz out of the way. Show it's growth, how it peaked at a 90 million market cap in the first 7 weeks - a unheard of amount for any altcoin/stock/business/community/organisation that started with squat.\n\n* How we helped fund the Jamaican Bobsled team and Shiva - the Indian Luge athlete. You should mention though, for accuracy, that Shiva ended up declining the donations and re-donated it into another Dogecoin charity in the end.\n\n* Other charitable work the commuunity has done. Save Dogemas, Doge4Kids, the two African water charitys... and I know of more, but I can't think of them right now.\n\n* Dogecoin being the first altcoin to have a lite wallet and explain what that means (I say altcoin because Bitcoin has had one before. Altcoin=alternative currency to bitcoin, while Cryptocurrency=these currencys including Bitcoin). That was huge news and was a huge feat for Dogecoin.\n\n* The tipping culture that is Dogecoin. Explain what tipping is. Mention and link to the Reddit tip bot, Imgur, Facebook, SMS etc. (More are on the way. I know a Wordpress tip bot is in the works too).\n\n\nThe rest I am not sure about. That is just my 16 doge.\n\n\n+/u/dogetipbot 50 doge\n\n", "score": 58}, {"body": "+/u/dogetipbot 500 Doge", "score": 7}, {"body": "+/u/dogetipbot 5 doge", "score": 2}, {"body": "Definitely talk about how *easy* it is.  Talk about people who are tired of unnecessary middle men in exchange processes.  Say you want to buy a car.  A seller doesn't trust a check.  You have to go to the bank, physically draw money from an ATM, get a cashier's check, or get an (expensive) money order.  Why bother?  You can now walk up to someone with your money encrypted on your phone.  You can scan his digital wallet with your phone, send secure money directly from your account, and it goes to *his secure wallet* almost instantaneously for essentially no fee at all.  Who *doesn't* want this?\n\nWe have a real, demonstrable improvement of properties in a currency.  An ideal currency needs to be divisible, fungible, transferrable, decentralized, scarce, and durable.  The money doesn't decay unless directly lost.  You can divide it out.  You can cash it in and convert it fast at different exchanges.  When you really start to look into the details, you see that this has *real* advantages over non-crypto monetary systems.  \n\nNow, what makes dogecoin better than others?  For starters, let's discuss its viral nature as its beginning.  People think it's funny, they spread it around, and then more people trade it.\n\nPeople that hold on to a currency in its infancy almost guarantee its doom: it reduces trade volume, and less people are involved and vested in it.  People frequently bring up the man who paid for a pizza with 10,000 bitcoins while it was getting started, now easily worth over half of a million USD.  If people *didn't* do these types of purchases, bitcoin would have never spread around enough to gain an interest.  Things don't have value if the majority of people *don't want it*.  Dogecoin has a *massive* trade volume because of its origin.  They picked the right philosophy, and they picked the right amount of coins to be made with a (healthy) steady rate of monetary inflation.  Monetary inflation is a good thing when people can lose their coins in cold storage permanently to a failed hard drive or general incompetence.\n\nBitcoin paved the way, but I really don't want to deal in 1/10,000th's of a coin for every day purchases.  Most people don't. Regular people can't mine it anymore because they can't afford giant ASIC arrays.  I'm not going to go into all the intricate differences, but by its very nature: it's *more* centralized than Dogecoin.  People are currently critical of crypto for its volatility, but this is only happening because it's still growing.  The more people get into it, the more it will stabilize.\n\nIn summary, I find it crazy that a few developers can find a more efficient, secure, and inexpensive way of delivering money than the best of the financial institutions.  When I buy a used car, I don't want to carry around dangerous levels of cash in my pocket.  I want to quickly and securely deliver my funds to the seller and drive away smiling, then take my rocket ship to the moon.", "score": 26}, {"body": "+/u/dogetipbot 500 Doge", "score": 6}, {"body": "Back at ya! +/u/dogetipbot megaroll doge verify", "score": 3}, {"body": "+/u/dogetipbot 5 doge", "score": 3}, {"body": "I think one of the most important aspects to address for a preliminary mainstream article is: What is Dogecoin and why do **you** want in on it?\n\nThat is, for individuals you can point out its utility as the new \"like\" on reddit, twitter, and (soon?)

Namely:\n\n* **1 minute blocktime** (vs 2.5 minutes for litecoin and 10 minutes for bitcoin) = **faster transactions**.\n\n* **Large pool of coins** which are more evenly distributed = larger audience for businesses wanting to accept dogecoins.  Also more coins = small transactions are easier to conceive (at present 1000 dogecoins ~= 1USD which means 1 coin is 1/10th of a cent).  If you want to tip a quarter to say a Journalist for a good article that would be 250 dogecoins or 0.00038 bitcoins.\n\n* **Pool of coins will continually grow** (at a decreasing % rate).  The currencies inflation will decrease (but still be present) encouraging spending and disincentivizing hoarding in the long run.  Also the continual coin payout (caps at 10,000 per block after January 2015) will help incentivize the miners (who are really processing all the transactions).

As you mentioned, a lot of other cryptos have a sort of \"secret society\" feel, and they don't like it when you shine the light on them. Dogecoin is the opposite from its inception. Within a few days of its creation it was being used to recruit people via 4chan and reddit with fun slogans like \"TO THE MOON!\" and our lovable shiba-inu mascot. The whole idea is to make something easily spreadable, and that is approachable. Almost like a virus. And I don't mean that in a bad way - the only thing that gives any currency value is people being willing to use it for commerce. If we can build a massive community that is willing to buy/sell using dogecoin, we win. That's why marketing and likability are so important. If we can get every single person on facebook, twitter, linkedin, reddit, and more to at least be aware of dogecoin, we'll become the most popular currency on Earth.\n* Community ownership. Seriously - think of dogecoin more as a cooperative business (or maybe a bazaar). We're all investing time, money, and energy in something we believe in. If someone has a cool idea, they run with it, and the community does what it can to support them.\n* TIPPING. The idea that you don't own .0000000000000000123 of a coin is great; when you own thousands (or hundreds of thousands or even millions of something) in a tight knit community no one feels bad about throwing a few dogecoins around. It acts as a great incentive to get people to join the community too. Just look at this: +/u/dogetipbot 25 doge (now, don't you just want to find a way to get that .025 of a dollar? HA)\n* We've had several successful philanthropic ventures that have been entirely crowdsourced. As I said, people have good ideas and they run with them. The dogecoin foundation helps back that up.\n* We lack the anarcho-capitalists that seem to predominate several other crypto-communities. We're not trying to bring down the IMF or attack \"the banksters\".\n* We are starting to grow up a bit. We are still a bunch of goofy spazzes, but we can be serious as necessary.\n\nOur marketability and strong community are what will make us succeed. The cute mascot and lack of \"BRING DOWN THE MAN\" sentiment makes us approachable (heck, the developer actively welcomes regulation). Active philanthropy lets us help the world, plus let's the world know that we're a real deal, and that maybe they're all better off having us around.

I'm thrilled that you are coming here for ideas and using this community as the great resource it is.\n\nA couple of aspects I think would be most beneficial to cover are:\n\n- The community! The number 1 reason I choose the Doge over any other currency is the community. The majority of Dogecoin users want the currency to succeed for more than just financial reasons, fervent in their drive even. There is a very utilitarian approach here that is quite contagious.  Even if one doesn't catch it themselves, it is very easy to see around the Reddit and Twitter.  Here, have some Doge \n\n+/u/dogetipbot 200 doge verify\n\n- However, most people reading Forbes are more concerned about Doge from a potential investment standpoint.  This, I believe, is where Doge really shines.  It is the only major crypto currency that is not a giant pump and dump scheme.  All others implemented a poor monetary policy imposing a limited coin supply to create demand to drive up the value.  This deflationary policy has worked great in the short term, bitcoin went hyperbolic with litecoin closely following.  However, once the available coins approach the ceiling, the incentive for mining drastically decreases.  As incentive decreases, so will the miners.  As the miners decrease so will the ability of the network to confirm transactions and make the coins more difficult and slow to use.  Not only will this increase the chance of a 51% attack as miners go offline but users will dump the slower less stable coins in favor of coins still actively being mined.  Eventually it will be a game of don't get caught holding the bag and last one out be sure to turn off the lights.  \nThe idea to not cap the Dogecoin supply in order to keep \"the spirit of Doge\" as a spendable currency rather than a tool for hoarding will ultimately drive the value the others currencies tried to create by making them horde-able.\n\nGood luck trying to capture everything that is Doge for the majority of outsiders.

Fundamentally, cryptocurrencies are specifications regarding the use of currency which seek to incorporate principles of cryptography to implement a distributed, decentralized and secure information economy. When comparing cryptocurrencies to [fiat money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money), the most notable difference is in how no group or individual may accelerate, stunt or in any other way significantly abuse the production of money.

Gaming communities overall, even if some are making comics or add-ons, are mostly full of takers (I am a gamer, also played WoW for 3 years). The people who play the game are passively playing and receiving updates. Most mod-users are not mod makers and fall into the complaint trap \"this stupid mod isn't good, they should fix it.\" They being some regular Joe like themselves, but they've disassociated themselves from other people at this point. The only financial transaction is people paying for mounts or expansions, thus they expect something in return, not exactly a giving world.\n\nHere though, it seemed to start with everyone being a giver. People tip others all day long, just because. Not only do they tip, but they donate. The whole world here originated in the spirit of giving. As recent postings in here about psychology have shown, giving makes people feel happier, even just tips on Reddit, whereas I think passively playing a game for years as a taker leads some to crankiness who want to make sure they get what's \"rightfully theirs.\" They paid for the game and every single damn thing better please them personally of they are gonna flip, \"give me more, make it better for me, I want it like this!\" \n\nDoge world, since it's creation has never been about feeling \"owed\" or paying others and expecting results. Instead it has been based on giving Doge to everyone, even mean people. Just a few days ago, someone here from another crypto was screaming \"your currency is a stupid joke.\" He was tipped. He then said \"fuck you, your currency is worthless.\" He was tipped more. He then said, \"I don't want this garbage, I hope you all fail!\" And he was tipped again and told to relax.\n\nEventually he just left, likely confused as hell as to why his further anger resulted in smiles and free money.

According to the article above what's probably going to bring bitcoin down is the fact that a few people own a great majority of bitcoins. When the vast number of bitcoin holders (who only own a sliver of bitcoins) get fed up with not owning more they will abandon bitcoin. SO, I'd like to point out that I kinda see that happening on a small scale already  with dogecoin. I'm one who does not have many (I don't have a mining machine and I have not bought any with real money. However I have recieved some great tips (which I have happily passed along) but here is where I've noted something beginning to happen. Before dogecoins began to get more popular the tips were awesome like 1000 here, 5000 there (inudog tipped me 80k once!) But now that dogecoin is getting more and more popular the tips seem to be getting smaller and smaller,  5 here 10 there occasionally a 100 tip will pop up. I think whats happening is the hoard mentality is slowing growing as the popularity of dogecoins does.  How do you fix it? I'm not sure, but at least remember to be generous to fellow shibes and let's not become the hoarding types like the bitcoin people.

Hugh Madden (CTO) and Dave Chapman (COO) co-founded the company back in June 2013.  We were formally known as Asia Nexgen (ANX.HK) and have recently rebranded to ANX at the beginning of this year.  We are currently supporting two sub brands ANXBTC and ANXPRO.  \n\nANXBTC is an easy to use platform for mainstream users to trade bitcoins.\nANXPRO targets experienced crypto currency traders.\n\nWe have been quite active in the Bitcoin space.  Here are some of the events:\n\nI was a speaker at the Bitcoin Singpoare event 2013 (www.bitcoinsingapore2013.com) and Hugh was on the panel.  Dave was also at the event processing customer verifications.\n\nWe ran a Bitcoin mixer in Shanghai (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=316477.0)\n\nI might have met some of you in Las Vegas when we sponsored the Bitcoin event http://www.mediabistro.com/events/insidebitcoins/2013/12/\n\nWe also ran the largest bitcoin giveaway\nhttp://www.coindesk.com/chinese-new-year-mean-for-bitcoin/\nhttp://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1416780/company-offers-bitcoin-instead-cash-lai-see-packets\nhttp://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gYtsqG7wwWJh5hbsIDNujjea-Qyg?docId=0a50f22a-b7b0-4869-abba-a5b10fec6eb4&amp;hl=en\n\nOur business address is located at Unit 701, 7th Floor, The Sun's Group Centre, 200 Gloucester Road, Wanchai, Hong Kong.  Our MSO is still showing our old address and we are already in the process of changing to our new office.  Many of our customers and partners have been to our office.  Some just to get the red packets :D\n\nWe have 20+ employees at our office.\n\nWe are a registered company in Hong Kong and we follow the laws and regulations here.  We are also a licensed Money Services Operator.  This is the equivalent of a Fincen MSB in the USA.  With this license we are required by regulations to do our due diligence in knowing our customers (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML).  I know it is a pain for some of you to verify but the governments of the world are watching this area closely and we have to do our part to stay in operation.  We are in this business for the long haul and we have a long term vision.  Cutting corners and sloppy processes will get us shutdown.  We take KYC and AML very seriously.\n\nWe do not maintain any infrastructure in our offices.  We are under using a DDOS and have all our servers compartmentalized to limit our risk exposure.  Majority of our coins are in cold storage off premise.\n\nHope this helps with some of the questions.  We are working hard to improve our website and the \"About Us\" and we are still completing the rebrand.  There are a million priorities as you can imagine and we  really want to get new features and streamline ease of use first.\n\nFeel free to reach out to us if you have any other issues and for those in HK we are usually at the bitcoin meetups here.

Look, what the OP is suggesting is not going to make much of a difference.\n\nWhy? Because, when you design an ASIC, a pure scrypt ASIC, to do Hashcat-scrypt (the name of the proof of work algorithm, btw), you have to choose an amount of memory? How much can you afford? 4K? 16K? 128K? 128K is quite expensive. \n\nColin Percival, the designer of scrypt, added in an /explicit/ time memory trade-off in his design. What does that even mean? It means that he knew someone could make an ASIC to do scrypt, and only use 4K of memory? So, here we go we have an ASIC with access to 4K of memory on chip. OK, so, Hashcat-scrypt as used by Dogecoin uses 128KB, how does that work? Well, it is a very easy to divide problem, so the ASIC just has to run the algorithm 128/4 times, or 32 times, instead of once. 32 times more. Does that seem like a lot? It isn't even an order of magnitude more. OK, so let's make it one Megabyte. Great, now 1024/4, owch now we have to run the algorithm 256 times. Seem like a lot more? It is one order of magnitude more. You really can't go much past 1MB. This chip will /still/ be more efficient per watt and way easier to manage than a GPU. \n\nHere is the real deal, Shibes. You can't stop this. The proposed changes only increase resistance. They do not add IMMUNITY. They can't! The builders of the ASICs will just run a little slower. It could buy time. But to those looking for the energy efficiency, ASICs will still be at the same relative advantage as the GPUs. The GPUs are going to get slowed down by the same amount as the ASICs. No one wins. You can't win, you need something more radical! Like throwing out scrypt.\n\nDoge will be practically mined out by the time ASICs become a force in the scrypt world. \n\ntl;dr, these ASICs will NOT be able to compute an order of magnitude faster than GPUs. The first Bitcoin ASICs were at least an order of magnitude faster. Comparing Bitcoin ASICs to Scrypt ASICs is like apples to REALLY BIG apples comparison. It isn't fair and it is a bit of fear mongering. \n\nFinal point: The gridseed ASIC doesn't even implement scrypt! It uses certain internal routines that are common to bitcoin and dogecoin to speed up dogecoin calculations. Based on the relative lack of success people have had with FPGAs (compared to their success with bitcoin in the FPGA world), I am not worried about ASICs or FPGAs messing up the scrypt world right away.

And not just cheaper: we're talking at least a factor of 1:4 before people start considering the switch.\n\nUnlike SHA-256 ASICs, which barely have a memory requirement (100 BYTES) and therefore are capable of hashing as hard as a $1000 PC on a thumb drive, the very idea that you need to jam both processing and memory into a Scrypt ASIC will hopefully keep production costs high enough.

The card contains a private key signed by the mint, which is itself then used to sign transactions. When making a payment, the sender gets the ID of the receiver. The chip decrements the balance stored within it and signs a message stating it has done so and that the recipients ID should increment its balance accordingly, this message is then presented to the recipient's chip which verifies the signatures and adjusts its own balance.\n\n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image**](http://i.imgur.com/Zcl9Vif.jpg) [^(i)](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MintChips_and_Accessories.jpg) - *A pair of MintChips \\(centre\\) and accessories from the Mint.*\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Royal ^Canadian ^Mint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mint) ^| [^Cypherpunk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk) \n\n*^\\/u/PcaKestheaod ^can ^reply ^with ^'delete'. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less.* ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/) ^| [^flag ^a ^glitch](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/autowikibot&amp;subject=Glitched comment report&amp;message=What seems wrong: (optional description goes here\\)%0A%0A---%0A%0AReply no. 43570:%0Ahttp://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1wzivt/i_just_realized_this/cf70e15)", "score": 4}, {"body": "Fun fact.

The community seems to be motivated by altruism rather than greed.  \n\nThe Dogecoin community is linked to the charity.

Usually your pool has some sort of guidance what to put to make sure you are pointing your miner towards them (Usually in their \"Getting Started\" section).\n\nAnyway, my current .bat file looks something like this, which you can just copy and add your details to (without the quotations of course):\n\n\"cudaminer -i 0 -C 1 -H 1 -m 1 -l *T12x32* --url stratum+tcp://*stratum7.dogehouse.org*:*9090* -u *YourPoolUsername.YourWorkersName* -p *YourWorkersPassword*\"\n\nAll things in italics are things you'd replace with your own info.\n\nReplace \"stratum7.dogehouse.org\" with your own pool's address (that is usually shown in the \"Getting Started\" section on their site). Replace \"9090\" with their port. Replace YourPoolUsername with your username to that pool, and YourWorkersName and YourWorkersPassword with the name and password you made up for the worker you created which you want to be using your miner (you can do this in most pools by going to \"Edit Workers\" section or similar).\n\nLastly, the T12x32 is a setting you can change depending on your card. I think your card might perform similarly to mine with that setting, so I recommend you give it a try! If you want Cudaminer to automatically choose the setting for your video card, replace \"T12x32\" with \"auto\". This will make your Cudaminer try to detect the best setting for you each time, or until you change the .bat file to something else. All of the other stuff are various settings for Cudaminer, telling it how you'd like it set up, I'd recommend you delve into this more once you are comfortable with things!\n\nOnce all that is done, just double click your bat file and you're good to go! this will always be how you start mining, by clicking that .bat file. It should start up and begin mining to your pool!\n\nDon't forget, make sure you go to your pool's site, and go to your account info, and add your payment info in there (aka the address to your dogewallet!).

How long will it take Bitcoin to get to where we are today? Incomparable.\n\nI am not suggesting we wait for anything specific, but I am suggesting that we don't have to rush to accommodate conventional commerce.\n\nThe current political debates are about the legitimacy of any crypto currency. We're a tiny part of the focus of that debate but we really don't need businesses to back us in it. We need user numbers to grow, increasing volume and value of transactions. That's the critical mass - get enough usage that retrospective regulation would be politically dangerous. I'd say we're not perceived as much more than an amusement and we'd be laughed out of the room if we pretended we had any leverage or even contribution at that level of discussion. No doubt in time that will change, but we're young and chaotic and I think that's working well for now.\n\nBig business does not want to help us. There is little incentive or potential ROI in early adoption for such a tiny market. They don't want to rush into expensive system upgrades, they don't want to mess up their relationships with the banks, the banks don't want to lose their control over revenue (ie profits), the governments are advised by the banks and can't operate without income from their cartel based system. \n\nThis is a paradigm shift. The last (and only) time I saw something like it was when mp3s and Napster changed everything because the technology just could. Stakeholders in the legacy systems were ignorant and slow to respond but when they did, it didn't end well for Napster; yet Piratebay are still breathing years later.

There is already a good start because some stuff is already in place because of the structure of Reddit or because people are actively developing it.  The principles I will present here are from my experience organizing volunteer and non-profit organizations.  Some of it may seem trivial, so please ask questions if anything seems irrelevant or poorly explained, and I can direct you to examples.\n\nThe first thing is to communicate what the community is aspiring to, and how it expects to get there so people can understand why they might want to be involved, what we seek to accomplish together, and how we will do it.\n\nA mission states how the vision will be achieved.   There is already a semblance of a mission:  \"a place to discuss dogecoin, come up with new ideas with the community.\"   I would propose tweaking that language a bit.  Something like:  \"/r/dogecoin is a supportive culture where everyone is welcome to learn about and discuss dogecoin with the community.\"\n\nTo give that mission context, let's come up with a vision that espouses the values of Dogecoin.  It should be short (ideally one sentence) and inspirational, but very clear and concise.   A vision is what an ideal world would look like if that mission were carried out perfectly.  An example vision could be:  \"Dogecoin will become the most widely used and fun cryptocurrency.\"\n\nOnce you've set the foundational center with a good vision and mission, it's time to set some basic goals.  Dogecoin intends to attract X new shibes, and Y new miners by Z time.  That gives people a sense of purpose.  Once that basic purpose is laid out, then coming up with the next \"send the Jamaican bobsledders to the Olympics\" type of goal will be key.\n\nBefore we get there, though, let's work on growing this community.  Let's create some roles within this community to help and guide newbies so that when people come to learn about Dogecoin, they have a positive, welcoming experience. Dogecoin ambassadors, if you will.  Let's give such ambassador shibes lots of recognition and praise.  Doges love praise.  We already reward with tipping, which is awesome, but people respond well to recognition, too.\n\nWhen creating goals, determine some tasks that are short and likely to be successful.  Write a simple description of the task so it's easy to understand what to do, how to do it well, and how long it should take.  Match up ambassadors with volunteers who are doing the tasks to provide guidance and support.  Once newbies have successfully accomplished tasks, gotten guidance and praise, and feel a part of something bigger than themselves that is doing good things, we will be starting to successfully build a solid, sustainable culture that can grow and scale up without losing its center.\n\nThat's what I've got for now.  I'd be happy to talk more specifics.  I do this kind of consulting for a living, and have implemented organizing and decision-making structures in non-profits and businesses, so I'd be happy to give some ideas about that, too.\n", "score": 2}, {"body": "Wonderful!

If you don't, I personally count the TPD (total power draw) as your cost.

However if you are like me, who already keep the machine idling for remote access (and logging/dev/work/testing) purposes, running the video card at 100% is only going to be drawing an extra 150-200 watts of marginal usage.\n\nSo now you can do the math. As for gains, typically it works out to $2-3/day at that *particular* day's exchange rate.  Hilariously enough, when its value tanked after Christmas I was getting 5-6k doge/day, which translated to about $2.50/day at 50 satoshis/doge.  This week however as the value is manipulated to the sky, I would be lucky if I broke 2k/doge a day, it was closer to 1.5k. At ~200 satoshis/doge during the sustained peek it works out to about $2.70/day.\n\nNow profit is different.  My electricity costs 18 cents/kWh.  At the turning on the entire machine just to mine example, the electricity usage is 12kWh/day and that works out to $2.16/day. At my example where I only really need to put extra power into the video card, that works out to $0.85.

Buy a $10 CD get \u00d050. 1 CD = \u00d010. It's like getting 5 CDs for free. Now people that still buy CDs at Walmart will know about doge. People will tip facebook comments, imgur comments, reddit comments, youtube comments.\n\nBloggers will make their living on tips. Youtube's competitor opens up a website around dogecoin sharing and tipping videos. People will tip each other. People can tip each other with free dogecoin that they throw out on those airplanes in parades. It'll be light hearted enough that people will throw it at each other in tipping contents but serious enough to be able to buy diapers on Amazon with them.\n\nPeople will mine and the ASCIpocalypse never comes. &lt;technobabble&gt; will solve all minor\n&lt;technobabble&gt; issues that are discovered.

He tips the pizza guy a \u00d01 with his phone after paying the company with his credit card. The pizza guy takes his \u00d010 and buys his way into an underground club.\n\nThe US will always have the USD. Your W2 will always be in $. You will always pay taxes in $. Your company will pay you over the table in $. Maybe they have \u00d0 giveaways. Coworkers will tip each other in \u00d0. Teachers will handout \u00d01 doge tips for good grades.\n\nEdit 1: Communes will sell food in \u00d0. People are tipped on the commune in \u00d0. They sell the power generated by their windmill in \u00d0 to the local farmer. QR codes scratched into rocks of \u00d0 are traded in Africa for goats. The goat farmer buys some rice with his \u00d0. \n\nLiteCoin finds its niche implementing an 'offline' mode where you can have a semi-local amount of LiteCoin without having to sync to the full network.\n\n\u00d0 is always quazilegal by the US and most governments. It's not technically illegal. The 28th amendment (and legal equivalents around the world) \"Prohibits the making of any law respecting an establishment of any specific cryptocurrency, abridging the freedom to mine or interfering with cryptocurrency internet traffic\".\n\nIt's a currency with an API. Accepting \u00d0 doesn't require legal tender. It doesn't require an anti-counterfeiting strip. All that you need to give, get, earn, win, gamble, spend and mine doge are lines of code. People tattoo *their* QR code onto their forearms. Safe deposit boxes hold the QR code of the private key. Upon their death all \u00d0 are given to the doge foundation unless a bot or tipping fountain is specified in the will.\n\nEdit 2: \u00d0 is like a bucket of sand. I can pinch off a tip. I can donate the whole bucket. I can dump the bucket and split it in half and hand it to 2 people. I can get out a \u00d0 measure and scoop out exactly 1 \u00d0 and use it just like 1 \u00d0.\n\nCountries and political dynasties crumble. The world on a single currency \u00d0 builds a high speed train to the moon.\n\nAll the meanwhile you can tell your great great grandkids that once upon a time on this one website everyone gave each other the \u00d0, always just a tip.\n\nEdit: [2].

Bitcoin isn't bad, no cryptocurrency is, but there are a lot of people who got into Bitcoin for the wrong reasons and it caused bubbles, lack of fluidity, an uptight community and crashes. Don't think I'm sticking it to Bitcoiners! :P\n\n2. Yes there are a ton of other economic reasons that the price of coin changes, but what is undeniable is while every other coin went down (during recent Bitcoin crashes), Dogecoin went up, and we can attribute that to it's most unique variable - it's people. Spending on community is something tride and true, whether that be giving o your churches potluck, or buying in-game currency for a \"guild\". We will buy our way into joy and friendship\n\n3. The comparison to virtual world currency may bother some people, this isn't me saying that Dogecoin is less legitimate, it's just me suggestion that perhaps all virtual currencies are more legitimate than we give them credit for. The biggest difference is Dogecoin isn't limited to change hands with in a certain game (but it does require a specific network apparatus). At the end of the day Cryptocurrencies are a highly engineered economic system, not a natural occurring one, and so by studying video game economics we can draw a better understanding of our economic system. If that interests you I can highly recommend hunting down some papers/web pages about the economy of Eve Online, or reading this paper (http://download.cipsoft.com/documents/Macroeconomics-english.pdf) by one of the creators of an online game called Tibia where he wrote his Masters thesis on it's macroeconomic system.\n\n4. *\"Hey Adam, I think you got this economics thing wrong\"* - fair, first and foremost economics is not my primary practice and it hasn't been for a while. The explosion of non-traditional economic systems (video games and cryptocurrencies) has got me delving into it more. I focus more on behavioral analysis and trends - the bizzare human side of economics. A lot of what I say is over simplified and may be askew with some economic theory (let's face it, there is a bunch of them) but I think we can agree on the final point that spending is key!\n\n5. *\"Hey Adam, what if I don't spend?\"* If one person doesn't spend it isn't the end of the world, what we want to avoid is one of two scenarios. 1) Nobody spends and so the currency is seen as useless and drops off to zero. 2) Nobody spends and the currency becomes so hard to get your hands on that the value shoots up which either leads to the market flooding and crashing as people try and sell, or people hold even longer that the value becomes so much that no one ever wants to spend it and the market crashes. Glum and blah right?\n\n6. *\"Hey Adam, why should I listen to you over anyone else?\"* - Oh god, you shouldn't! I'm just a dude on the internet. You shouldn't listen to me, you should read my opinion and make a rational and educated decision for yourself, critic me, question me, but don't ever follow anyone, even me, without asking questions! I hope to help, but at the end of the day I could be wrong.

This means one of two things that either the coin will have such low fluidity no one will trade it, or that it will skyrocket in value as it's rare to the point that no one wants to trade or accept it and it's hyperinflation on set denominations causes it to crash.\n\nFor a currency there is such a thing as too valuable.\n\nBut that's my big fault with Bitcoin and one of many reasons I think it will putter out.

Glad you asked it - Gold is pretty complicated as in our modern market it is actually really crucial for computers and cellphones as it's a great conductor, this means we see gold traded as an investment, a reserve, and a commodity which makes its value pretty hard to pin down.\n\nHistorically though gold was shiny, it was used to craft into other things and show wealth and it still had an independent purpose (showing the peasants how wealthy you are) cryptos don't quite work the same way just due to their intangible nature - and that's ok - but the key difference to note is that there is always a purpose for gold and it is decreasing invalue as there is less and less of it in circulation every day.\n\nFor this reason gold and crypto do trade a bit differently (that and gold is an ancient and established market), simply trading on the exchanges doesn't open up enough \"fluidity\" (my rubbish coined term for some complex relation of trade value) to sustain a currency on its own.\n\nAt the end of the day a currency will always have one challenge, and its trying to meet the needs of its owner; by needs I mean on a Maslow Heirarchy of Needs.

But they don't often provide us with needs (food, shelter, warmth etc) and we have to trade out to USD if we wanted to pay a bill.\n\nFor this reason the ease of trade is CRUCIAL, which for us is ok, because its so rapidly trading hands its relatively easy to get in or out at any time; if we ever bridge the gap and could reasonably pay our bills, rent and food costs in Doge we'd survive on less fluiditiy.\n\nUltimately its not an easy answer, current economics systems grew out over hundreds upon hundreds of years, we can't expect to create a new one in a few months, but that doesn't mean we won't truck on, just means direct comparisons are challenging as the world today isn't exactly England in the 1400's :P\n\nI hope this has answered your question without creating too many more.", "score": 5}, {"body": "First off, this might sound like I am challenging your points, which I am not.

I know it might seem unnecessarily complicated and completely pointless, but it's only so in this early stage before we get this thing really going.\n\nEven better would be if you start spending more (in fiat worth) when the value of the coin increases. Of course bitcoiners have been asking for people to spend too, but so far they haven't succeeded very well. Everybody wants someone else to spend while they hold all of their BTC that will make them billionaires. Maybe we could use the dogecoin community spirit to get everyone to spend for the good of the whole community and doge and ultimately ourselves too.

The only proof they will accept is some form of digital tracking or a label number from the parcel service.

The fraudulent buyer only has to file a \"not-as-described\" claim after it has arrived, instead of \"non-receipt\". Ebay will have them return the paper wallet, and the buyer will simply clean out the account before sending it back. That said, if someone does this more than a couple times, their account may be investigated and/or suspended for excessive/fraudulent claims. It seems crazy to me that someone would risk an eBay account over no more than a couple hundred dollars in doge, but I realize petty crime is a real thing. \n\nThis isn't just exclusive to cryptos, either.

I was perched a month before that bubble happened ready to start mining LTC and i dun fucked up and tried to get 300 million total credits contributed to milkyway with my computing farm before I started mining. I had 3 7950s a 6970 and 2 5870s running and installed with LTC miners a month before that bubble, and i'd have made more in that month than i've made in the entire time since then o_O. Such is life, I'm here now, shit's happening, and I've got other non crypto investments I've made as well growing for me as well. hoping I can invest well enough in the first few years that I won't have to work and can focus on throwing kick ass events for a living as my job to keep myself sane so I'm doing something with my life.", "score": 9}, {"body": "idk i don't pay it XD", "score": 5}, {"body": "Jesus, what's your electrical bill look like?

Most pools run the v1.4 wallet as the pay wallets because the v1.5 is SERIOUSLY broken when it comes to pool use (more later).\n\nYesterday morning a huge block/transaction (nearly 1MB in size) was added to the blockchain and the v1.4 wallets died because they couldn't process that size block. The 1.5 wallets carried on however as they are based on LevelDB which can handle larger TX and so the chain forked... essentially a 1.4 fork and a 1.5 fork.\n\nNow, the issue we have right now is that the 1.4 wallet has been patched to get us past the bad block and we could run that but will simply die again if another large block hits the chain and we will get hit with orphans and ultimately the pool will die. On the other hand there is the 1,5 wallet....\n\nThe 1.5 wallet has a huge issue with sending the amount of coins/transactions that a pool sends. The long and short is that we ran a bunch of payouts to test and most got there but some got stuck at 0 confirms and will not update even with a kick. Obviously we cant do that as the coins are stuck in limbo at present.\n\nSome of you have reported that your TX isn't showing at dogechain and these are the \"limbo\" coins. Don't panic - YOU WILL GET YOUR COINS SOON.\n\nAll large pools have the same issue at present and they aren't running payouts either. Mining is still working fine though and your coins are accumulating, we are just struggling to get them to you at present. Really sorry for the inconvenience.

You contributions are appreciated, and we hope to go above and beyond our target in helping this cause.\n\nThe US$30,000 raised will help sponsor:\n\n- Two litters of puppies who\u2019ll be trained and paired with children as they grow up\n- Two adult service dogs being placed with families in need\n\nOnce the campaign is funded, our friends at 4 Paws will post regular updates including photos of the sponsored puppies and service dogs, so we can track their progress.\n\nLearn more and donate at: http://doge4kids.org/", "score": 82}, {"body": "\u00d01,000,000 sent. \n\nThis is worth it.

In Asatos house dog's stupid sayings were undercooked in English, the dog is christened \"Doge\", a misspelled variant of the English word dog. . \"Wow, much cake search delishus\" said the Doge, or: \"Much fun Very amuse..\"\n\nThe Internet loves such things arbitrarily in its absurdity exaggerated ideas that eventually only the open up, who was the creative process someway. The appeal of such codes is in their conspiratorial use: Everyone understands the brand language from Apple or Coca Cola, but only insiders understand the Doge. The website KnowYourMeme.com elected Doge's most popular meme of 2013.\n\nThe dog face now graced countless threads and comments on Reddit and 4chan, the hotbeds of the Nerds, where the weary and underdogs of the internet roam. A diffuse mass without an agenda, which quickly organized to fun activities and then decays again.\n\nOnly rarely does it happen that the host of Bored find a goal that sustained evokes enthusiasm. The fact that great things can then be illustrated by the establishment of the hacker collective Anonymous on 4chan. Once set in motion, with an ideal in mind, the swarm in a direction begins to move - and he does it then with enthusiasm. And so it happened that the Doge came to his own currency two months ago.\n\nThe biggest online currency \"Bitcoin\" had made in the past year with an enormous price increase sensation. The crypto money that consists only of a difficult encrypted code had remained hidden for long in the dark corners of the internet, in the fora of the darknet about where you can swap the anonymous digital currency against drugs, hacker attacks, or child pornography.\n\nAs of 2013, the media became aware of Bitcoin, the height of flight arrived: investors discovered his potential as an object of speculation, the exchange rate multiplied, and he who had acquired a few Bitcoins few years ago, was suddenly dollar millionaire.\n\nThe Australian marketing expert Jackson Palmer found the absurd, almost as absurd as the Doge with his Bl\u00f6del sayings. End of November 2013 he suggested in a forum before jokingly, to continue to invest in the \"Dogecoin\".\n\nThe reactions were euphoric. Inspired by the popularity of the web community Palmer made with the American computer expert Billy Markus to work. Within a week, they crafted a working crypto-currency.\n\nOn 6 December 2013, the launch was announced - initially on a bitcoin forum. In addition to an image of Shinu Iba stood there: \"Dogecoin - very currency - many coin - wow - v1.1 Released.\" Now only missing the users.\n\nBecause Bitcoins and Dogecoins, as well as Euro or dollars are fiat currency. They have no inherent value; This comes only through social construction of their concentration. Only when enough people of the coin concede a counter value there is a market and a course. And so awakens a per se is worthless thing at a time to live, just as in the Biblical Genesis: \"Fiat Lux - Let there be light\" - only that it must mean in this context: \"Let there be money.\"\n\nThe Doge any case drew. Already in the first days, hundreds of Internet users downloaded downloaded a program that can be created with the Dogecoins. The so-called Mining (German: degradation) assume the users complicated computing tasks that need to be addressed when encrypting Dogecoin transactions.\n\nThe release of each task in turn is rewarded with a small amount Doge. So countless Dogecoins emerged out of nowhere, out of the way and-forth small amounts and the required computational work, suddenly.\n\nThe hype was launched: Within a week Dogecoin had 1000 followers on Twitter, 1800 Likes on Facebook and 2,600 subscribers at Reddit. It did not take long, and the first Dogecoins were exchanged for Bitcoins, the currency was given a monetary value. Just ten days after the start had Dogecoin already a market capitalization of 1.5 million U.S. dollars.\n\nIn contrast to the Bitcoin Dogecoin has a clear advantage: He loved it. Everyone knows Netzbewanderte the grinning Shina Ibu - and the idea to elect a symbol of the internet as a symbol instead of a dead president continues viral. Anyone can participate in it: While a Bitcoin around the 500 euro cost to a Dogecoin is worth only a fraction of a cent. This leads to a playful, not entirely serious handling of the currency. When Reddit users are now able to send instead of a thumbs up small amounts of Dogecoins.\n\nUsing an Alternative Currency, becoming the subversive statement. The more value and distribution rise, the more discover his followers in her the potential to carry the underdog status in the real world.\n\nWhen it became known that the penniless Jamaican bobsled team may compete for the first time since 2002 at the Olympic Games, the Reddit community called for the donation. Within a few hours she collected Dogecoins worth $ 30,000 and referred her to the team.\n\nIn the same way the Indian luger Shiva Keshavan was supported, must stand as a stateless because of a corruption scandal of its National Committee. Just by the media response to the fundraiser for Jamaica doubled the price overnight.\n\nAnd the hype continues. Meanwhile, the Dogecoin is with a market capitalization of $ 80 million, the fifth largest crypto currency after the Bitcoin , he has more than 168,000 followers on Twitter and 60,000 subscribers to Reddit. Trend: Strong rising.\n\nAs last week supporters of Dogecoins spontaneously gathered for a demonstration on Wall Street, they stacked the sculpture of Wall Street bulls over a larger than life Dogemaske. The optimism of the stock exchange, the Charging Bull embodies, now also applies to the freaks of the dog economics: To the fullest confidence in the course of Dogecoin they have chosen a new target: Currently they gather for a manned mission to the moon.", "score": 63}], "1wblo7": [{"body": "I am not saying that SunliMin is advertising a virus but it's never wise to download and run an untrusted executable, especially not when it's posted to a forum where most people have a wallet on their computer.\n\nLearn your safe cross code fellow shibes.", "score": 7}, {"body": "Fellow shibe, why does VirusTotal say your game .exe is HW32.CDB.6c95?", "score": 2}, {"body": "Reminds me of a game a guy had me make for him for the lulz.\n\n\n[Need For Doge 3: Most Wow](http://download1785.mediafire.com/ux9oka7xadtg/xhhn00zed9291cs/NeedForDoge3.zip0)\n\n\n\n              such fun\n                                         most doge\n                         very drift\n            wow\n\n-----\n\nThe guy below claims he got results claiming my game was \"HW32.CDB.6c95\"(which I am assuming is infectious or something?

This is done in Photoshop CS3 on a PC.\n\nFirst, open up Photoshop and activate the animation menu via Window &gt; Animation. You should see a new bar appear at the bottom. Next, create a new file via File &gt; New and set the dimensions that you want. I used 300 x 300 pixels. Resolution is set to 72, background color to white.\n\nYou might notice that at the bottom in the animation area, there appeared a rectangular box. This is called a frame. Now, you do something to the image. For example's sake, let's import a [dogecoin png](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/65/Dogecoin_logo.png) in order to animate it. Just copy the image from the url and paste it in Photoshop. Use the magic wand tool (hotkey W) to select the black background and hit Delete to delete it. Then, press Ctrl+D to deselect everything.\n\nThe image with your dogecoin image in it is now the first frame. Now, click the new frame button in the animation frame (it's the one that looks like a notepad with a little edge on it). You now have two frames in the animation bar. You now need to duplicate your coin. Select Window &gt; Layers if it is not already selected. You see your dogecoin layer. Drag the dogecoin layer image to the New Layer symbol at the bottom (again, a notpad icon with a little edge on it). It's now called \"Layer 1 copy\".\n\nIn the second frame, you start animating the coin. Make sure the second frame and \"Layer 1 copy\" are selected, then pess Ctrl+T to bring up the free transform mode. Bring the mousecursor outside the box that appeared, until you get the \"curved arrow\" symbol used for rotating. Hold the shift key while dragging in order to rotate the image in \"steps\", so you can get a consistent animation. Press enter to transform the transformation.\nAfterwards, click the little eye icon left to \"Layer 1\", to make the original doge disappear. Click on Frame 1 to see that \"Layer 1 copy\" is still visible, so make it invisible by clicking the eye.\n\nYou now have two frames in your animation, Frame 1 with \"Layer 1\" visible, and Frame 2 with \"Layer 1 copy\". If you skip between those two frames, you can see the rotation occur.\n\nYou will now need to reproduce this step for as many frames as you want in your animation. New frame, new layer, transform the doge, adjust the visibility of the new layer in all other frames, lather rinse repeat (if someone knows a better way to animate transformation, please inform me!). You'll get the hang of it pretty quickly. I came up with \"Layer 1 copy 24\" at the end of the animation, so I repeated the step 24 times.\n\nIf you now press play in the animation bar, you see that the images rush by pretty quickly. This is because you haven't set the duration yet. Click the first frame, then hold shift and click the last frame. This selects all frames. Now click the text that says \"0 sec\" below the frame and change it to \"0.1 sec\". Et voil\u00e0! When you play it again, it should animate smoothly.\n\nChoose File &gt; Save for web and devices, select gif as a format and export it.\n\nNow you're done: your very first GIF! \n\nPlease note that animation movement of a layer is easier to animate. You can just add a new frame, move the layer around, and be done with it. For some reason, Photoshop applies transformation of a layer to all frames. I don't know how to stop that.\n\nLet me know if you have questions left!\n\n[Anyway, to the moon with you.](http://i.imgur.com/kR8SEvk.gif)", "score": 32}, {"body": "If you don't mind at all, I would love to see a brief tutorial :)", "score": 2}, {"body": "I'm not OP, but it's not difficult to do in Photoshop.

When used by academics, an arbitrage is a transaction that involves no negative [cash flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow) at any probabilistic or temporal state and a positive cash flow in at least one state; in simple terms, it is the possibility of a risk-free profit after transaction costs.

From there... ummm... poke around a bit.  Dogecoin is an internet currency like bitcoin but we are growing at a FAST pace.  If I had a dogecoin for dummies video, I'd insert it here.  Ask questions, most people will help with pretty much anything.  There is no such thing as a stupid question, just stupid people asking stupid questions.  KIDDING!  There are 2 ways to get Dogecoin.  Either \"mine\" it using a specialized computer, or buy it on a market like a stock market.  Buying off the market will be the quickest way to acquire dogecoin and  the most cost effective too since building a computer takes money you have to put in to get money out but that's a whole nother topic (/r/dogemining if you are curious).  The market options are pretty vast and though I don't have a master list, here are a few off the top of my head.  \n\nhttps://www.vaultofsatoshi.com/ (highly trusted bank.  I personally went with these guys.  Good service, not fast but accurate.)\n\nhttps://moolah.ch/ (This one is in beta testing I think.  I'm not getting replies from emails I have sent but they are VERY busy in getting their services up and running)\n\nhttps://coinbase.com/  (I've only really heard bad news about these guys but they may be good.  I'd ask around here before I sign up with them.)\n\n/r/dogemarket if you want to buy coin TODAY (beware of scammers though)\n\nThere are a number of online retail stores that are starting to accept dogecoin too.  Again, I don't have a master list so I can't point you in a direction to spend your coin.  Someone reading this can reply to me to give you a store or 2 that accepts doge. \n\nWelcome to /r/dogecoin, you're never going to leave now!  hahaha  :)  This is the friendliest subreddit around.  I'm not kidding about not leaving... I've been here since Jan 30 and I spend about 95% of my reddit time here now.  This is true for a lot of people here.  (leave while you still have the chance!  Kidding, stay please!)\n\nEdit: The 1000 doge tip you got sent is worth roughly $1.40 right now.

The first is that it is based on an unfair stereotype of Native Americans, that they don't keep their word. In the other popular explanation, the term doesn't cast aspersions on Native Americans, instead it echoes the broken promises the whites made to the Indians. Neither is accurate, although the first is closer to the truth.\n\n\n---\n\n_Instead the term comes from different commercial practices. To the Native Americans, who had no concept of money or currency, gifts were a form of trade goods, of exchange. One didn't give a gift without expecting one of equivalent value in return. If one could not offer an equivalent return gift, the original gift would be refused or returned. To the Europeans, who with their monetary-based trade practices, this seemed low and insulting, gifts were not for trade but were to be freely given._\n\n\n\n_The noun Indian gift dates to 1765. Indian giver follows about a century later in 1865. Originally, these reflected simply the expectation of a return gift. By the 1890s, the sense had shifted to mean one who demands a gift back._\n\n\n---\n\n[^(about)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autourbanbot/wiki/index) ^| [^(flag for glitch)](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/autourbanbot&amp;subject=bot%20glitch&amp;message=%0Acontext:http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1wkqno/dogecoin_is_now_1_in_all_crypto_currencies_see/cf2zait) ^| ^(**Summon**: urbanbot, what is something?)", "score": 2}, {"body": "Much agree.

Seriously jellous. \n\nHere are some reasons why its obviously superior (in many ways) mining in USA compared to Australia.\n\n* Our power is typically $0.30/kWh (AUD) which is about $0.26/kWh (USD). In southern states and rural areas it can be much more.\n* Your EVGA powersupplies would be next to impossible to get a hold of. Not only does EVGA have a very small market presence here, but they are preordered to infinity by keen miners and children with rich parents so they can play battlefield on 4 NVIDIA GPU at once.\n* That rack would cost $200 here because we don't have magical places like wallmart and home depot.\n* We pay what we jokingly call \"Australia Tax\" on literally every IT item and digital media that enters the country. Comparing prices with our #1 stores to newegg (even after taking exchange rate into account) is enough to make me cry. Given that it's actually cheaper to ship components from countries that manufacture computer hardware to Australia, I've never understood why we pay more.\n* Most of the good mining R-series cards (R9 270, R9 290 in particular) are perpetually sold out. Heaps of websites will say there's stock but then you call the store to check and they've been sold out for months. Their solution is to just keep upping the prices until people stop paying for them, so you end up with some 270's costing well over $300 AUD.\n* We don't have newegg and other mega-vendors so buying mining parts usually means long drives (even in major cities) to stores that have stock OR placing online orders with no-name IT parts websites\n* What is amazon?\n* What is biostar?\n* Seriously, that CPU/RAM/Mobo combo would cost twice what it does for you on newegg\n* The only motherboards available here with 6 PCI-e slots cost &gt;$200 and you'd have to double check that they can even mine with that many GPU's. The exception is AsRock BTC Pro - which is technically sold here - but has been continuously out of stock for months. If you are lucky you can get a vendor somewhere in the country to put your name down on a piece of paper for the next time they get a stock delivery. ie. 1-2 month wait usually.\n* Risers like that take twice as long to deliver to my country (4 weeks) whereas I understand most Chinese products can make it to the USA in two weeks or less... or I suppose you just get it from amazon\n* Most of Oz is a hot hell hole. It's typically 30 degrees C (86 f) 3 seasons of the year where I live. It'll be only 15 deg C (59 f) in the coldest winter nights. Read: huge air conditioners required, or miners kept outside exposed. Refer point 1.\n* I see you used R9 (290?)X's with REFERENCE COOLERS. You have to be a complete twit to buy those in my country, it'll hit high 90's within a few seconds. The solution is to pay an extra $50 per card for the heat-pipe based coolers.\n", "score": 16}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 17}, {"body": "How is that wired?

I think the elasticity of demand is super high here which means that you seriously reduce the barrier for someone to pay by implementing this kind of system. It also helps because the step up is so small compared to free tubesites and it still gives people the feeling of belonging to some sort of inner circle. \n\nGreat Idea and I could see this working very well in a lot of contexts (also monetizing podcasts etc.)\n\nedit: for those of you wondering: elasticity of demand means how sensitive demand is to price shifts. Cigarettes for example are pretty inelastic because most cigarettes are consumed by smokers who are addicted, a lot of entertainment however has very high elasticity and thus demand can increase a lot with a lower price. See steam sales for example. While the extra publicity definitely plays a big role, the small price leads to a much higher demand and causes many people to pay for games they won't ever play (I too have a pretty big steam graveyard of games!).\n\nPorn consumption, I would assume, also has a very high elasticity, especially since there is so much free porn out there. That means that content producers have to set themselves apart from the free stuff available and they can increase total revenues by carefully calibrating their prices. The microtransactions possible with digital currencies would be a fantastic way to test this and make purchases hassle free!\n\nElasticity is a pretty exiting topic and very important particularly in the information age we live in. Digital goods are free to produce, which means the marginal cost of production for another unit is essentially zero. How is it possible to incorporate this fact into distribution models that benefit both consumers and producers? I think we're seeing a lot of paradigm shifts in this direction, and dogecoin and its tipping culture can play a small but important role in these developments. For example: While I would have written my economics columns for free anyways, the generous contributions of the dogecoin community resulted in me actually making a small bit of money from writing them!

At the moment for it to be interesting for on-the-ground operations, you really have to be small and just set it all up yourself (with a little help from us or the payment processor) for fun and some extra exposure with the crypto crowd. I doubt that crypto payments will get any sort of traction in chains and larger businesses before payment processors offer an auto-conversion to fiat money.\n\nThe trial investment has to be near 0 for it to spread, and there cannot be an extra department or technician attached to keep it running - it has to be as convenient as any other type of billing. I think the tipping point is when both a super-good POS app on a cheap tablet and a payment processor that auto-converts to fiat currency are available. That's when it is nearly as convenient as credit cards for restaurants, and at a lower cost. That is the moon for retail, pretty much.", "score": 6}, {"body": "Hi! Thanks for the write up. You should look into a career/part time writing sales copy.\n\nCouple of thoughts from the operations side of restaurants. I've brought this up to a few high level decision makers in large scale operations a handful of times over the last year. They all say the same thing: it's too volatile and the cost outweighs the benefits. I'll give you what they give me when I bring it up:\n\nSetting up a system in a restaurant to accept crypto isn't too terribly difficult, albeit initially expensive and moreso to scale. The constantly changing prices are hard to work with in this industry and would require backend work. It doesn't matter what doge/BTC/litecoin is at right now, a steak will cost what a steak costs at a given point with little to no change.\n\nSo the price changes we know that. If I accept doge in a restaurant, now I have to hire a full-time (currency exchange is 24/7) employee or department to exchange it at the best rate. If the price of doge/usd tanks and no one is spending doge, I still have to have the department to monitor and exchange it in case people do, and that costs money. Or automate currency exchange. And if I'm automating currency exchange I would just sell that service and be rich. \n\nIt isn't \"mainstream\" enough for the initial trial investment. Even bitcoins. Sure the allure is rad and you'd have people who would use it, but if 99% of your customers use USD why hire and pay new employees for a system and upkeep of the currency 1% (maybe less) uses? There isn't profit in that and, aside from having a cool technophile set of software, there isn't much benefit at all, let alone enough to switch to a crypto system.\n\nPersonally, I think it would be cool to see. There aren't many restaurants in the us where you can pay in cryptocurrency (that I'm aware of) and it would be classified as \"cutting edge technology\" I think.

Who better to have there than the Founders of dogecoin! \n \n \nImagine, a few fans decked out in DOGECOIN/JAMAICAN apparal. It is bound to recieve some attention during the bobsled telecasting. Also, we can get in touch with the team and do pictures and promo nonsense. (more front page reddit posts)  The press would gobble this up. Not to mention the chance that the Jamaicans do well and possible place/medal. Can you imagine them celebrating with a few dudes wearing dogecoin t shirts?\n\nTickets/travel costs would sum up to a few thousands bucks for a few guys to go and pump the olympics with dogecoin! Well within our reach of fundraising.  And we could even print out like a thousand paper wallets with 100 Doges. Hand em out to those interested. oh man oh man!\n\n\n\n**EDIT: the message I sent to mods...**\n\nHello, Firstly I want to thank you. Creating dogecoin has been nothing short of inspiring for so many people. You have impacted so many in such a positive way... Thank You.\n\n \n\nSecondly, I think we have an obligation. This recent development regarding the bobsled team is unreal! When I suggested we help fund the Jamaicans I never anticipated this happening so fast and becoming such a big deal. This publicity is phenomenal! In my opinion, it needs to continue! Both yourself and Laika1954 have been amazing and we couldnt have asked for this to go any better! The press will certainly hype this up in the coming days and hopefully it will continue up to and through the Olympic games.\nBut imagine if the founder of Dogecoin (you), the fundraising manager(Laika1954), and the brain child of the whole thing(myself), went to the Olympics in person to not only support the Jamaicans, but help promote/represent Dogecoin! The press will be swarming the Olympics. With the already hyped up buzz of Dogecoin and the Jamaican Bobsled Team, they would eat us up! Three fans wearing Jamaican/Dogecoin paraphanalia! Not only would it be phenominal press, it would be a once in a lifetime oppurtunity! One month ago, none of us thought any of this was on the horizon, yet here we are solidifying Dogecoin in the Cryptoworld and literaly laying the tracks for what is destined to become a sequel to a legendary movie. Being there in person would achieve so much. Making headlines is fantastic, dont get me wrong, this is all fantastic, but if we were to make it on internationally televised television..... Thats an entirely different story!\n \n\nIf word surfaced we were attending the games, it might inspire other shibes to do the same! We could find ourselves in Russia with hundreds of Dogecoin Shibes! Ya never know! This could literally rally the entire nation of Jamaica to support Dogecoin! This is something in my eyes that needs to be seized. Im not one to let oppurtunities pass me by. I believe we can take some time off, and enjoy a lovely few days in Russia. Pictures with Bobsled Team. Interviews with news outlets. The entire world in one place... with all eyes on Dogecoin, How can we not be there!\nPlease think this over. A week off from our daily lives isn't too much to sacrifce.

I'm one of the lowest hashrates on the pool I mine at, it's time to quit...\"\n\nSo I shut down my miner, sold most of my BTC (around 500 or so) and forgot about bitcoin for about a year and a half. \n\nChecked the news again and the price had jumped a little. $30 USD at the time, and I thought to myself: \"What if I had just kept mining? What if I had just kept my coins? $30 a day is some serious extra income.\"\n\nSo imagine my face when I saw BTC pass $100, then $500, then hit $1200. Imagine how hard I was kicking myself. I can guarantee you aren't imagining hard enough. \n\nSo in July I started buying GPUs and building mining rigs and started mining Scrypt coins. \n\nSometimes it has been good, sometimes it has been bad, but there have been a lot more better days than not. \n\nAnd then Doge came around and I haven't mined anything else since. \n\nSo word of support and advice to all of you: It doesn't matter what your hashrate, it doesn't matter what your rank on the pool, it doesn't even matter if Doge goes up and down. \n\nDig, dig, and keep digging. \n\nDogecoin has already rocketed past almost every other established scrypt coin in a crazy short time, and the reward halving is going to give us another boost. \n\nAnd one last piece of advice: Don't be like me and BTC and sell out too early.

It grows on a flowering plant with sharp thorns, and the fruit is harvested when still green but ripens to yellow. Thought to be an ichang papeda - bitter orange hybrid, the Kabosu was brought over from China in the Edo Period and became a popular fruit in Japan. It is produced in most areas of \u014cita Prefecture but particularly in Taketa and Usuki. The actual fruit is regarded as a delicacy in other parts of Japan, as it is often expensive outside of \u014cita Prefecture. It improves the taste of many dishes, especially baked fish, sashimi and hot pot dishes.\n\n&gt;\n\n---\n\n[^(**Picture**)](http://i.imgur.com/LQzd13R.jpg) ^- ^(**Unripened Key limes**)\n\n[^(image source)](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Backyard_limes.jpg) ^| [^(about)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| *^(/u/pelvicpenguin can reply with 'delete' if required.

We brought the moon down to us!! You guys are really something.\n\nOkay! I am in touch with a friend of the athlete's and I have some more information. Many of you messaged me asking who really was in need of the money. Keshavan Shiva is. The other two luge athletes are not the focus of our fund raising. Apparently someone had told them recently that they would raise the required money, but didn't contact them after that. So they are a bit leery. Here is what the athlete's wife, Namita, had to say:\n\n*Shiva is sponsored by the Olympic Gold Quest, and endorses a few brands in India. He has been managing to train and compete with all the money he raises personally. In simple words, he mainly represents the country at his own expense. FYI, the total required budget for a Season is approximately INR 50 Lakhs (~80K$), which Shiva has raised personally all these years. There are no facilities or infrastructure in India, which forces him to train abroad, something like the Jamaican team. It was 2 months prior to the 2010 Olympic Games and now for the 2014 Games that the Govt. offered support, nothing in the middle. Also, please note that they were part sanctions, which means they only gave him 5-10% of the total amount actually required by him. I write all this for your information, so that it is clear who and why you all are supporting the Indian athletes.*\n\nThe money you guys raised will help cover cost of equipment and travel. We are waiting for Namita to get back online so that we can figure a way to give her the money.\n", "score": 99}, {"body": "I'm not 100 percent certain on this, but they are not allowed to wear any advertisements on their gear.", "score": 4}, {"body": "Having the picture of a Doge on his suit?
