Plus as said, people need to be able to trust that things like this stay the same; without confidence this coin (or any) has no value.\n\nSince we're already changing our mentality to \"buying time\" the X11 algo should be seriously considered.

There is absolutely no need for more units as 10^15 is several orders of magnitude over the whole of IPv4 space.\n\nIf we want to secure the hashrate merge mine with LTC or become ASIC resistant. Extending the mining period will just drive the price down below the point that it would make sense for anyone to continue mining it. Those invested in expensive ASICs are not going to mine away on a \"currency\" that isn't worth a single satoshi.", "score": 29}, {"body": "I think changing the reward schedule is a bad move.  The reasons you have outlined are pure baloney IMO (I just did myself out of any chance of winning that ASIC, didn't I).  Last time, we had very valid reasons to fork the coin - multipools were gaming us by only mining the high reward blocks, and the diff took a while to self-correct meaning less money for everyone who was doing the right thing.  This time, the threat is slim to non-existent.  We have far more to lose by forking the coin than we do by sticking with what we've got.\n\n&gt;Unfortunately, we're now running into the same problem - because our overall hashrate is low, and the difficulty levels are reaching points where it is once again extremely profitable for multipools to hop on to us. Our primary danger at the moment is that our block reward halvings are far too frequent, which is not allowing for enough time for our price and difficulty to stabilise against them.\n\nLet's pick these apart one by one:\n\n* Hashrate low - changing reward schedule won't help this.  Hash rate and diff will self-regulate to break even.  If a coin is profitable, more people jump in.  If you are mining at a loss, you generally leave.  Recently it has actually been excellent, despite the halving I have been pulling in the same doge/day because the multipoolers left.  I do agree with a higher hashrate being better, **this is why we need ASICs in the hands of every shibe**.  Distributed hashrate discourages large mining operations and secures the network.\n\n* Diff low making it profitable for multipools - well, we need to increase our hashrate!  Why is the diff so low when everyone was jumping out of their chair about the supposed ASIC threat??  Obviously this is wrong!  ASIC farms cannot be mining our coin if we have such a low diff.  They may be interested, but only if there is profit for them.  We need to make sure there isn't by - you guessed it - increasing our own hashrate.  The best way to do with this is lots of small, efficient ASICs in the hands of everyone.\n\n* Block halvings too frequent for price and difficulty to stablise - this is wrong on both counts.  Difficulty stabilises instantly thanks to digishield.  Our price has been stable against the USD at around $0.43/1k for ages, and the last halving had barely any effect on price.  It has slipped against BTC recently but this is because BTC has shot up in value.  This is a **great thing** - it means our coin is now worth what it is worth in the wider marketplace rather than being \"tied\" to BTC as common perception used to be.  We are growing up and our price is becoming independent from BTC.\n\nI actually think the sooner our block rewards decrease to the final 10k value the better.  This then becomes a nominal reward scenario and there is no profit to be had in setting up a large mining operation, ASIC or no ASIC.  Block rewards are simply a maintenance feature to keep people mining for the good of the coin.  It's a \"hey, thanks for all the good work\" pat on the back now and then.  If you're only consuming 5-10 watts using an ASIC you paid $100 for then that reward is plenty.\n\nThe other side of this is we need to make sure the dogeconomy is healthy before block rewards settle on 10k.  By healthy, I mean we need more transactions.  Most of our blocks have very few transactions in them, we need to focus on growing this by buying and selling goods and services in DOGE.  The coin has existed for 6 months, and look how far we've come.  We have another 8 months to work on the economy, so I think we can get there in time.\n\n**Delaying the reward dropoff only maintains profitablility for the coin.  Profitability is an attractant for ASIC farms and multipools serving their own self-interest.  We are far better to let the profit phase spin itself out and focus on building the dogeconomy.  A currency is supposed to be traded, not mined and speculated on.  We need to make sure our transactions are frequent, healthy and that the traded value stays in DOGE rather than being converted to fiat.**", "score": 53}, {"body": "Yes, totally agree. No taper.

Yes, I know Ileti has lots of both, and I know he's a good shibe, but that doesn't make this a sensible thing for him to say.**\n\nIt might be a good idea in a purely technical sense but it won't fly because it would divide the community too much.\n\nUnrelatedly, I upvoted thedownvot's comment but shame on him for saying something \"would completely destroy\" Dogecoin.

People generally watch the 'hot' page and the 'new' page and everything in the middle tends to get lost, so the challenge is gaining enough momentum before the topic falls off of the new page, which at peak times can be ruthlessly quick.\n\nIt's a timing issue, largely. You have to time the topic/post at a peak enough time to gain the momentum it needs to reach the front page, but you don't want to hit such a peak time that it gets drowned under threads in 20 seconds. (The NASCAR races, for example, probably saw a peak of upwards of 30 topics created per minute).\n\nIf your topic or post doesn't gain traction at first, don't take it as a sign that /r/Dogecoin doesn't care or doesn't want to help. This community is just about the most caring, generous community I've ever been fortunate enough to be a part of online.

Most people will use an electronic version of a wallet, but wallets can be as simple as a piece of paper with your keypair written on it (these can be made into a barcode scannable QR code to remove the need for manual entry). The Public key (often referred to as your \"address\") is known to everybody and is how the blockchain keeps track of how many coins each address has, and how you send and receive coins with others. You keep your Private key secret, and it's how you verify that you are the owner of the coins in the corresponding address.

The light wallet. And my first and biggest concern/question is surprisingly difficult to find an answer to i think. I don't have a username, right? I don't have one specific adress, right? I have like.. 100 adresses or something? But i do have this wallet. I gave that first wallet a name and password protected it. \n\nYou do not have one username across the entire network. I think you should look at this like a bank acount. This made it a lot easier for me.\n\nWhat you have made is a \"bank account\" on your computer. You have an \"account number\" which you can give to others so they can send you coins. These would be such  account numbers(1): [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/iyRcWFn) .\n\nJust like in a regular bank you can make as many account numbers as you want, In this case you can even give them a name(2)(that's what that label part up top is for). \n\nThe main difference between a bank account and a doge wallet is that all coins which are sent to the account numbers you see for that wallet are in that wallet.\n\nSo in my case: \n\n- Someone sends 2 doge to Moolah\n- The wallet called Johnnie now contains 2 doge\n- Someone else sends 5 doge to Litebit\n- The wallet called Johnnie now contains 7 doge\n- I can now send anyone else 7 doge from the wallet called johnnie\n\n***\n\n&gt; But what if my computer spontaneously combusts in five seconds? How do i then reach this wallet? Is the wallet bound to this computer? Is it bound to my ip? If i download a wallet on another computer, i have to start over with a new wallet and 0 dogecoins?\n\nThat is a good question to ask yourself.\n\nIn essence the answer to your question is: in the current state your coins will be gone.\n\nNow how to prevent this: make regular backups of your wallet. \n\nHow do you do this in multidoge?\n\n*First of all: as far as I know there is no way to automatically make backups of your wallet.(please correct me if I'm wrong) *\n\n- First select the wallet you want to back up on the left of the multidoge screen(just click on it.)\n- Now click on tools at the top of the screen and click on export private keys.[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/meY49Nz)\n- You will now see this screen: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/sJgb2Ee).\n\n- - Here you want to click on \"export to\" and select the location where you want to save your backup.(I reccommend doing this on one or more USB drives which you then store somewhere safe)\n- - You can now choose to put a password on this backup. I really recommend this. If you don't, anyone who gets his hands on these files will be able to spend your dogecoins.\n- - Now click export private keys.\n- - You now have a file (or several files) which you can use on another computer if this one explodes.\n\nI recommend that you backup your wallet after every time you add more account numbers and before you update your multidoge installation. In case something goes wrong you always still have the ability to keep using your wallet.\n\n- To load this file into another computer instead of the pile of rubble that was your previous pc: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/LowGaPz.png?1)  follow the next steps.\n\n- - Install multidoge on the new pc.\n- - Click on tools in the top and click on import private keys\n- - Plug a usb stick with the backup into the new pc\n- - Find the backup file after clicking on import from\n- - If necessary: enter the password you put on the backup\n- - Click on import private keys\n\n\nNow for the other questions/the global question:\nYour coins are attached to the wallet you created. Your ip address and computer are irrelevant. As long as you have your wallet(or backup/copy of your wallet) you will be able to access your coins. With the process I've shown you above you essentially make a copy of your wallet to put on another pc if this one crashes/explodes.\n\nAnother analogy: You have a bank account with one bank and it goes bankrupt. With this process you will be able to go to another bank and say: here are my account numbers. They will then be able to give you back all your accounts with their contents.\n\n***\n\n&gt; Can i get a wallet for my phone and it will be the same wallet i have for my computer? \n\nYes it is possible but it is a lot simpler to just have a seperate doge wallet on your phone. I unfortunately do not know if/how to make backups of a phone wallet(I do not have one).\n\n*Before you continue: if you have an iphone you will not be able to use a dogecoin wallet to send people dogecoin.(blame apple) *\n\nNow for android:\n\nHow to get one is simple: [go here](http://dogecoin.com/getting-started/) click on phone wallet and you will be able to get an app and send coins to it to pay people with dogecoin. It looks fairly self explanatory and I don't have it so no giant how-to for this.\n\n***\n\n&gt;Basically, i simply don't get how this works without any username or whatever. \n \nNow the one point I think you have missed about all this: there is no central server telling everyone who everyone is and which addresses exist. \n\n*Before anyone freaks out: this is what it looks like from the outside. The actual code may be more intellegent but this seemed to be a good way to explain it. *\n\nEssentially you only have one big list of transactions and your wallet simply picks out all the transactions which are sent to an address that it recognizes.\n\nThe other way around it simply adds a new transaction to this list from you to another address which may or may not be linked to a wallet. It checks if the address you enter COULD be a dogecoin address (12345 does not work) but it does not verify it through some system of usernames and linked accounts.\n\nBasic Analogy: you send a transaction with your bank to someone else but the bank does not verify if the address you send the funds to is correct and/or is linked to another person.\n\n***\n\nI hope I haven't scared you off and that things are a bit clearer now.\n\nLet me(/or anyone else) know if you want some extra info and we'll try to answer.", "score": 7}, {"body": "There's a file called a wallet file, often called wallet.dat (but this can vary depending on the wallet you have).

I primarily handle IT and web stuff, but I was brought along on a meeting with another partner of ours; there was a dearth of usable media and flavor text for our website, so I was going to see what I could get from our partners and listen in on the meeting for anything that could fill a webpage. This was my very first in-person meeting with any of my company's partners.\n\nWhen we got there, in addition to the people I was expecting, I was greeted by three Toshiba employees. Before going any further, it'd be good to note that Toshiba is a Japanese company. I don't know if you know this, but [business cards are pretty serious business in Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_card#Japan).\n\nAt no point did anyone at my company warn me or give me a crash course in accepting business cards from Japanese people, but I was fairly familiar with the customs thanks to being, ever so *very* slightly, a weeaboo. \"Bitch, I've browsed J-list, I've watched Outlaw Star- I know the drill,\" I thought to myself as I accepted their business cards with the utmost professionalism, confident that my years of watching Toonami and browsing 4chan had chiseled me into the most Japan-aware man in the state of Ohio. \n\nThere was a problem, though. Since I had no idea any Toshiba representatives would be there, I didn\u2019t think to bring a business card holder, or anything else \"card appropriate,\" and I was pretty sure I'd look like an asshole if I just jammed them into my pocket- so I tucked them neatly inside my precariously bound, pocket-sized spiral notebook. I know what you're thinking. \"A spiral notebook? What is this? High school?\" But, I assure you, my notebook was the epitome of class. You'd kill for a notebook even half as sharp.\n\nAfter the exchange, we shuffled into the boardroom. An hour or so in, some difficulties arose and it became clear that everyone who didn't need to be in the room should find somewhere else to be. I and a fellow IT guy under our partner\u2019s employ conjured up a believable reason for why we should be in *not* that room right away, and we got up from our chairs. I had forgotten that my awesome, perfectly pocket-sized notebook was not in my pocket as it most often was, but rather on my lap. As I made my escape, my notebook spilled open, releasing the Toshibamen\u2019s cards to the floor. Unsure if they could see what I had just done, I scrambled to pick the cards up, accidentally stepping on one and *audibly* bending another in the process. They knew. I didn\u2019t turn to look, but I could hear and feel the face of everyone on our side of the table contort into a pained cringe.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how much this incident contributed to the very unhappy faces everyone was wearing when they came out of the boardroom half an hour later, but I can tell you I was not brought to any more meetings.\n\n**tl;dr:** man with superhuman awareness of Japanese culture accidentally looks like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCKjctTWIsw)\n", "score": 18}, {"body": "Very computer.", "score": 8}, {"body": "U got my uprocket :D :D :D", "score": 21}, {"body": "Amaze   much clever", "score": 7}, {"body": "They have a pc model called satellite too.

Why does the dollar have value, or the euro, or gold for that matter?  When you give someone money for something (say a pizza), the person accepting it has full faith that someone else will exchange that money later for something they want. When you tip someone at a restaurant, it may be in exchange for good service, or because it is expected of you (USA). When you give charity, it makes you feel a little good inside.  \n\nWe tip each other similarly, for a shoulder chuckle, or a pat on the back, or just for the heck of it.  Some people to be nice, some people in hopes of more hilarious content.  Some people are in it just to give our reddit karma a little more value: to give someone a 'tip' upvote, or whatnot, it costs yours.  (Imagine reddit with a finite amount of karma, and to upvote someone else, you had to give them something of yours.  This isn't typical, but it is a way some people look at it.)  The recipient then, later has faith they can give it to someone else who will appreciate it, and 'buy' something they like.  I view it as more than just 'votes,' though, since it is possible to buy real, physical goods with them.\n\nWe're not quite like bitcoin, as in general people aren't hoarding it in the hopes of a similarly huge gain.  IMO, that is a Bitcoin downfall for now at least.  To be a currency, it has to be used for something.\n\nMy wife asked me at what price would I sell my Doge, and my reply is: when someone has some good or service I want and is willing to make an exchange.\n\nCryptocurrency is no different than a government currency, it has the value people give it.  It has advantages and disadvantages, of course.  Some are glad for the advantages, and feel they outweigh the disadvantages:  very cheap to send money to someone else anywhere in the world,  reasonable anonymity, no 'government interference' for the Libertarian group.  There is a risk that acceptance won't grow to include any product or service I want, and no FED, central bank, or equivalent to help any 'issues' that occur (though,  again, some argue that this is actually a good thing).\n\nIn the end I'm having a good time, and if it costs me a few 100 USD, or some computer heat and parts along the way so be it.\n\nAs far as world currencies go, we're in for a wild ride, one way or another.

Over the years several slight variations were designed by the team led by Dvorak or by [ANSI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_National_Standards_Institute). These variations have been collectively or individually also called the __Simplified Keyboard__ or __American Simplified Keyboard__ but they all have come to be commonly known as the __Dvorak keyboard__ or __Dvorak layout__. Dvorak proponents claim the Dvorak layout uses less finger motion, increases typing rate, and reduces errors compared to the standard [QWERTY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY)   keyboard. This reduction in finger distance traveled is claimed to permit faster rates of typing while reducing [repetitive strain injuries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury),  though this has been called into question. \n\n&gt;====\n\n&gt;[**Image from article**](http://i.imgur.com/gH4crMs.jpg) [^(i)](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:IBook_with_DVORAK.JPG)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Keyboard ^layout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_layout) ^| [^August ^Dvorak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Dvorak) ^| [^Words ^per ^minute](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_per_minute) ^| [^Typewriting ^Behavior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriting_Behavior) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cggxac3) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cggxac3)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)", "score": 6}, {"body": "I think they're talking about the [Dvorak keyboard layout,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard) which resembles the user name of /u/dvorwak ", "score": 7}, {"body": "I don't recognize your name, but you...\n\nI like you.

The term is typically used [pejoratively](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejoratively). Although salami slicing is often used to carry out illegal activities, it is only a strategy for gaining an advantage over time by accumulating it in small increments, so it can be used in perfectly legal ways as well.\n\n&gt;An example of [salami](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salami) slicing, also known as __penny shaving__, is the [fraudulent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud) practice of stealing money repeatedly in extremely small quantities, usually by taking advantage of [rounding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding) to the nearest cent (or other monetary unit) in financial transactions. It would be done by always rounding down, and putting the fractions of a cent into another account. The idea is to make the change small enough that any single transaction will go undetected. \n\n&gt;In [information security](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security), a __salami attack__ is a series of minor attacks that together results in a larger attack.

Only the two transfer drivers will also have that same data. While there will be practice sessions, those 3 drivers will have the most up-to-date feel for the track before the main event.\n\nHopefully Josh will be able to fight his way up each segment. The danger comes from the possibility of someone derping out and wrecking the Dogecar in the open race the night before. So if he trusts shibes to vote him in, he may well choose to ride around at the back and use that race as a test session to prep for the main event rather than go for one of the transfer spots, even though they would earn him a slightly better qualifying position in the main event.

The top 2 finishers get to transfer from this open race to the main event, joining the winners. Josh will be competing in the open race vying for one of those two spots, but he'd be up against some stiff competition.

I just wanted to pop in with a quick history lesson to underscore why it's important for you to keep voting if you want Josh to win.\n\nOverwhelming open votes like this is not a new thing in NASCAR. My favorite driver, Bill Elliott, won the similarly open [\"most popular driver\" award](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR%27s_Most_Popular_Driver_Award) *16 times* over the course of his career, because of his obsessive fan base. A few of those were probably legit, particularly in the late 80s when he was tearing up Talladega at ridiculous speeds, but the rest was because of a highly organized campaign by his fan club to snag it every year. We're talking about doing this when you had to phone or snail mail in votes, through the opening of NASCAR.com, all the way to 2002. In that time, other vote brigades have popped up in response for the All Star race and any other votes. That's at least 30 years of experience NASCAR fans have in doing this. The point?\n\n**This is not the standard situation we've seen in other open votes (like Time's Person of the year) where an Internet vote brigade rolls into town, catches everyone off guard, and floods the results.**\n\nRather, this is a situation where an Internet vote brigade enters a field of other highly organized, very experienced vote brigades. Danica has certain structural advantages in her favor. Like Josh, she also brings in fans from outside NASCAR. She also has a million+ Twitter followers who can be kicked into action. She has a large official fan club who are just as obsessed about getting her in as you are about seeing the Dogecar run past the showdown.\n\nOn top of that, there are other Bill Elliotts out there (luckily he's retired,) dark horses with smaller but even more dedicated fanbases. It has happened in the past with the fan vote.\n\nMy point is, don't rest on your laurels. Don't underestimate NASCAR fans of other drivers.

It can literally be exchanged for $USD or tons of other things, or you can buy things with doge like giftcards and stuff on https://treats.io/ and once we get more widespread, more businesses will accept us, so you can use it elsewhere as well.\n\nThink of it like this... USD is money that everyone transfers, but a lot of people trade it out for gold because gold holds its value as it is basically the universal standard... and then they hoard that gold and do nothing with it.\n\nWell, on the internet, the same thing can be said about doge and bitcoin. Bitcoin is a currency as well, and it has been around longer so you've most probably at least heard of it, and it has a lot more value than doge right now, but people hoard it and that makes it not realistic to be used as money, so a new replacement was made that people can feel comfortable spending and using, and that's called dogecoin. It's like the dollar of the internet, it has a lot of real worth but it isn't so much that it is intimidating, and so you're welcomed to spend it and use it, and every time you spend it and use it it helps give the coin even MORE worth, because it's still a really young currency.\n\nBut don't get me wrong, it's not affiliated with bitcoin at all, it's its own unique currency that has value separate from bitcoin, just like the USD has value separate from gold, but the value fluctuates and is somewhat tied to each other even though they're both completely unique, based on the economy.\n\nAs for us, our value is going to pretty much only go up from here, because it is also tied to our economy and our community, and with the charities and the NASCAR sponsorship and news about us, thousands of people are joining our ranks and you're going to see a boom here in the next year or so just like what happened with paypal back in the early 00's, where it goes from being a very niche thing to bursting forth and being accepted everywhere.\n\nSo hopefully that doesn't confuse you further and helps clear things up. It's a unique, independent currency that's as physically real as money on a debit card is. It's strong enough that we bought and paid for the dogecar sponsorship with dogecoins, so it obviously has to have plenty of worth.\n\nIf you want to know more from people who are more knowledgeable and can explain things better than me, just head over to /r/dogeducation and find you some information!", "score": 3}, {"body": "I don't really know what doge is but voted!", "score": 8}, {"body": "He looks godlike here!\n\n\n\u0f3c \u3064 -_- \u0f3d\u3064 Good work, keep voting -&gt; such dogesuit\n\n", "score": 4}, {"body": "This is insane, guys!
